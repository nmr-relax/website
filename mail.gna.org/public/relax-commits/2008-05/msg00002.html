type the name of that directory at the end of the last command.  
Modifications can be made to this copy while normal development continues on 
the main line.  Once the desired changes have been made and reviewed the 
changes which have occurred on the main line can be merged into your 
branch\index{merge}\index{repository!merge}.  If development is taking a long 
time then merging should occur on a regular basis to avoid large incompatible 
changes forming between the two branches.  For example to merge the changes 
which have occurred between the initial branch, say r2351 (revision number 
2351), and r2378 of the main development line type in the base directory of 
your branch

+
+As you develop your branch, changes will be occurring simultaneously within 
the main line.  These changes should be merged into your branch on a regular 
basis to avoid large incompatible changes from forming between the two 
branches.  To simplify this process, the \texttt{svnmerge.py} script located 
at 
\href{<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.orcaware.com/svn/wiki/Svnmerge.py}{http://www.orcaware.com/svn/wiki/Svnmerge.py}">http://www.orcaware.com/svn/wiki/Svnmerge.py}{http://www.orcaware.com/svn/wiki/Svnmerge.py}</a>
 can be used.  It is best to download the trunk version from that page, 
unless that version is non-functional.  Once you have this script, the 
merging from the main line to your private branch must be initialised by 
typing, from within the checked out copy of your branch,
+
+\example{\$ svnmerge.py init}
+\index{Subversion!svnmerge.py init}
+
+This then needs to be committed using the automatically generated log
+
+\example{\$ svn ci -F svnmerge-commit-message.txt}
 \index{Subversion!commit}
 
-Make sure to include in your commit message the revision numbers which have 
been merged (cutting and pasting the command would be useful).  This is 
important because if new changes need to be merged again, for example up to 
r2401, then you will need to type
-
-\example{\$ svn merge -r2378:2401 svn+ssh://xxxxx@xxxxxxxxxxx/svn/relax/1.2 
.}
-\index{Subversion!merge}
-
-Note that the changes from r2351 to r2378 have not been merged for a second 
time.  This is important and is the reason that the revision numbers need to 
be noted in the commit logs.  Once you have completed your modifications, you 
have merged all changes which have occurred in the main line, and the changes 
have been approved for merging back into the main line then your branch can 
be merged.  First check out a copy of the main line,
-
-\example{\$ svn co svn+ssh://xxxxx@xxxxxxxxxxx/svn/relax/1.2 relax}
+To keep up to date, simply type
+
+\example{\$ svnmerge.py merge}
+\index{Subversion!svnmerge.py merge}

+If conflicts\index{Subversion!conflict} have occurred please refer to the 
Subversion book at

<pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi Seb,

I have just performed a little clean up of the &quot;Consistency testing&quot;
chapter of the relax manual.  This is now in a pretty good shape to
ship out to users.  I was wondering if you'd like to add some small
text as the end, a last paragraph maybe, explaining why the script
generates the F_eta and F_R2 values.  From reading the references,
this is obvious.  But if a user reads this chapter as it is before
jumping to your papers, they will be confused.

Cheers,

Edward

-As shown in Figure \ref{fig: consistency analysis}, the example data 
displays both consistent and inconsistent data. In fact, data recorded at 
500 MHz and 600 MHz are consistent together, whereas data recorded at 800 
MHz is not consistent with data recorded at 500 MHz nor 600 MHz.  Since 
more than two magnetic fields were used, this allowed the identification of 
the data from 800 MHz  as the inconsistent data, as data from 500 MHz is 
consistent with data from 600 MHz, and vice-versa.  In this particular 
example, this allowed the authors to take special care with data at 800 MHz.
-
-This inconsistency of 800 MHz data is seen on the correlation plot (toop) 
by a deviation from the dotted line (which represents the theoretical 
situation when equal $J(0)$ values are extracted from both magnetic fields. 
It is also observable in the histogram (bottom) where the ration of the 
data from two magnetic fields is not centered around 0. In fact, there 
seems to be a systematic shift of the calculated $J(0)$ values at 800 MHz 
when compared to the two other magnetic fields. This is caused by a similar 
shift in the experimental $R_2$ (transversal relaxation rate) data.

-For the 500 MHz and 600 MHz data pair, the data are centered around the 
dotted line in the correlation plot (approach A, top left) as well as 
centered around a value of 1 in the histogram comparing the ratios of 
values from both magnetic fields (approach B, bottom left). Of course, 
there are some outsider values even in the case of consistent data. There 
are caused by specific dynamic characteristics of these spins and are 
different from systematic inconsistencies such as depicted in the example 
above with the data recorded at 800 MHz.

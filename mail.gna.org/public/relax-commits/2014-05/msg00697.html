  Math-domain catching for model: 'NS CPMG 2-site expanded'.
  
  task #7793: (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/task/?7793">https://gna.org/task/?7793</a>) Speed-up of dispersion models.
  
  This is to implement catching of math domain errors, before they occur.
  These can be found via the --numpy-raise function to the systemtests.
  
  To make the code look clean, the class object &quot;back_calc&quot; is no longer
  being updated per time point, but is updated in the relax_disp target 
function in
  one go.

  This is to implement catching of math domain errors, before they occur.
  These can be found via the --numpy-raise function to the systemtests.
  
  The skipping of test when num_points &gt; 0, is a bad implementation.
  If such a case should show, it is best to catch the wrong input for the
  calculations. This is best done with a check before running the 
calculations.

  task #7793: (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/task/?7793">https://gna.org/task/?7793</a>) Speed-up of dispersion models.
  
  A weird behaviour was found when running the test-suite.
  
  Somehow, queued jobs from the last test suite was not flushed and done.
  Running the test-suite gave errors on almost all tests.
  
  Inspecting systemtest which only used calc() for the dispersion API, showed 
that no jobs was queued
  in the calculate() method, and the call to processor.run_queue(), was 
turned off, solving the problem.

  Reverted r23250-23248 as the correct fix was done in fixing bug 22055.
  
  bug #22055 (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/bugs/?22055">https://gna.org/bugs/?22055</a>) The processor.run_queue() does not 
clean up in uni_processor - chain-reaction failures in the test suite.
  
  The command used was:
  svn merge -r23250:r23247 .

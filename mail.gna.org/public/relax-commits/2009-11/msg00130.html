  Fix to the frame order system tests.
  
  This corresponds to the fixes in R_euler_zyz() where the rotation matrices 
were in the left-handed
  universe and hence the rotation was back to front.
........
  r9476 | bugman | 2009-09-08 16:40:16 +0200 (Tue, 08 Sep 2009) | 3 lines

  Function renaming and argument order changes in the 
maths_fns.rotation_matrix module.
  
  The naming scheme is now more logical (as well as the argument order).
........
  r9482 | bugman | 2009-09-08 18:27:50 +0200 (Tue, 08 Sep 2009) | 3 lines

........
  r9487 | bugman | 2009-09-08 21:07:41 +0200 (Tue, 08 Sep 2009) | 13 lines
  
  Added a unit test to bounce around all the conversion functions in 
maths_fns.rotation_matrix.
  
  This bounces through:
      1) euler_zyz_to_R().
      2) R_to_axis_angle().
      3) axis_angle_to_quaternion().
      4) quaternion_to_axis_angle().
      5) axis_angle_to_R().
      6) R_to_quaternion().
      7) quaternion_to_R().
      8) R_to_euler_zyz().
........
  r9488 | bugman | 2009-09-09 16:04:40 +0200 (Wed, 09 Sep 2009) | 5 lines
  
  Added a unit test to check if all the 
maths_fns.kronecker_product.transpose_*() functions revert.
  
  Calling the function twice should return the matrix to the original state.
........
  r9489 | bugman | 2009-09-10 14:33:33 +0200 (Thu, 10 Sep 2009) | 3 lines

  r9492 | bugman | 2009-09-10 16:54:55 +0200 (Thu, 10 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  The test_write_read_pipes() system test is now using the VALID_TYPES module 
variable to get all pipes.
........
  r9493 | bugman | 2009-09-10 17:01:39 +0200 (Thu, 10 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Deleted the __init__() class methods as these were empty, and shifted the 
docstring to that of the class.

........
  r9497 | bugman | 2009-09-10 17:38:20 +0200 (Thu, 10 Sep 2009) | 5 lines
  
  Shifted the test_write_read_pipes() system test to the 'state' test module.
  
  The program state is now being saved as the results file is for just one 
data pipe.
........
  r9498 | bugman | 2009-09-10 18:07:22 +0200 (Thu, 10 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  A few fixes for the test_write_read_pipes() system test.
........
  r9499 | bugman | 2009-09-10 18:32:31 +0200 (Thu, 10 Sep 2009) | 7 lines
  
  Redesign of the relax state loading for adding support for a XML formatted 
state file.
  
  Half of the load_state() is now in load_pickle(), and a new function 
load_xml() added.
  The determine_format() function will tell if the file is a pickle or XML 
file, and then
  load_pickle() will run the appropriate loading function.
........
  r9500 | bugman | 2009-09-10 18:36:40 +0200 (Thu, 10 Sep 2009) | 5 lines
  
  Added the pickle flag to save_state().
  
  This defaults to True to prevent relax failures during the XML file 
implementation.
........
  r9501 | bugman | 2009-09-10 19:01:25 +0200 (Thu, 10 Sep 2009) | 5 lines
  
  The save_state() function now calls the relax data store to_xml() method.
  
  This method is currently only for one data pipe, and is used by the results 
writing user function.
........
  r9502 | bugman | 2009-09-10 19:24:30 +0200 (Thu, 10 Sep 2009) | 6 lines
  
  The relax data store to_xml() method now can add all data pipes to the XML 
file (or a subset).
  
  The results.write() method now asks to_xml() for just the current pipe to 
be stored, whereas
  state.save() supplies no 'pipes' argument to have all pipes stored.
........
  r9503 | bugman | 2009-09-10 19:26:22 +0200 (Thu, 10 Sep 2009) | 5 lines
  
  Shifted the results.write() force arg to the end.
  
  Bool args should be last!
........
  r9504 | bugman | 2009-09-10 19:37:33 +0200 (Thu, 10 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Removed trailing whitespace.
........
  r9505 | bugman | 2009-09-10 19:56:32 +0200 (Thu, 10 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Updates to the load_xml() function.  This now does something!
........
  r9506 | bugman | 2009-09-10 20:04:05 +0200 (Thu, 10 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Created the relax data store is_empty() method.
........
  r9507 | bugman | 2009-09-11 10:06:05 +0200 (Fri, 11 Sep 2009) | 6 lines
  
  Added the pickle arg to state.save().
  
  This allows the relax state - the contents of the relax data store - to 
either be saved as XML or as
  a pickled object.
........
  r9508 | bugman | 2009-09-11 10:07:11 +0200 (Fri, 11 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Added a warning to the state.save() user function about the pickle format 
compatibility.
........
  r9509 | bugman | 2009-09-11 10:16:04 +0200 (Fri, 11 Sep 2009) | 6 lines
  
  Absorbed the load_xml() function into load_state().
  
  After shifting the data store check to load_state() for all formats, the 
function only had one
  statement.
........
  r9510 | bugman | 2009-09-11 10:29:08 +0200 (Fri, 11 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Docstring clarification of the dir arg.

  Updated the relax data store from_xml() method for support of the loading 
of the XML state file.
........
  r9512 | bugman | 2009-09-11 11:31:44 +0200 (Fri, 11 Sep 2009) | 5 lines
  
  Added the force flag to the state.load() user function.
  
  When True, this causes the relax data store to be reset prior to state 
loading.
........
  r9513 | bugman | 2009-09-11 11:36:02 +0200 (Fri, 11 Sep 2009) | 5 lines
  
  Duplicated the test_state() system test into test_state_pickle() and 
test_state_xml().
  
  This tests both formats.
........
  r9514 | bugman | 2009-09-11 11:39:53 +0200 (Fri, 11 Sep 2009) | 6 lines
  
  Fixes for load_pickle().
  
  The ds.__reset__() call has been removed because of redundancy and the new 
ds.is_empty() has been
  blacklisted.
........
  r9515 | bugman | 2009-09-11 11:48:17 +0200 (Fri, 11 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Changed the default save state to XML.

........
  r9517 | bugman | 2009-09-11 13:52:36 +0200 (Fri, 11 Sep 2009) | 5 lines
  
  Renamed the state.load() and state.save() directory argument from dir_name 
to dir.
  
  This is to bring it in line with the rest of relax.
........
  r9518 | bugman | 2009-09-11 14:44:41 +0200 (Fri, 11 Sep 2009) | 3 lines

  Final 1.3 line redesigns of the relax_io module.
  
  The log() and tee() functions have been renamed to io_streams_log() and 
io_streams_tee(), and the
  old IO.logging_off() class method has been converted to the 
io_streams_restore() function.  The
  io_streams_restore() function is also differently designed, using the true 
original IO streams
  (sys.__stdin__, sys.__stdout__, and sys.__stderr__).
  
  The IO.delete() method has been converted to a module function.
  
  The IO class has been eliminated.

  Created a module for alignment tensor related system tests.
  
  Only the single test test_to_and_from_xml() has been created so far.  This 
checks the dumping and
  reloading of alignment tensors into an XML file.

  Bug fix for the delete function.
  
  The function was failing if the file was missing!
........
  r9533 | bugman | 2009-09-18 18:28:05 +0200 (Fri, 18 Sep 2009) | 6 lines
  
  Bug fix for the test suite.
  
  The temporary files were not always deleted if a .bz2 extension was added!  
Now relax_io.delete() is
  being called to fix this.
........
  r9534 | bugman | 2009-09-18 18:28:56 +0200 (Fri, 18 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Reactivated the system tests turned off in r9533.
........
  r9535 | bugman | 2009-09-18 18:32:41 +0200 (Fri, 18 Sep 2009) | 5 lines
  
  Fix for the data_names() method for when no model has been setup.
  
  This allows the frame order data pipe to be written out prior to the model 
setup.
........
  r9536 | bugman | 2009-09-18 18:43:02 +0200 (Fri, 18 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Expansion of the test_to_and_from_xml() system test to check more data 
structures.
........
  r9537 | bugman | 2009-09-18 18:47:49 +0200 (Fri, 18 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  The data structures of the AlignTensorList class are now packed into the 
XML file.
........
  r9538 | bugman | 2009-09-18 19:11:30 +0200 (Fri, 18 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Added the blacklist arg to xml_to_object().
........
  r9539 | bugman | 2009-09-18 19:15:06 +0200 (Fri, 18 Sep 2009) | 6 lines
  
  Reverted r9538.  The wrong file was committed!
  
  The command used was:
  svn merge -r9538:9537 .
........
  r9540 | bugman | 2009-09-18 19:15:40 +0200 (Fri, 18 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Try again:  Added the blacklist arg to xml_to_object().
........
  r9541 | bugman | 2009-09-18 19:18:14 +0200 (Fri, 18 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Bug fix, the blacklist args now default to [].
........

  Fix for the test_to_and_from_xml() check of the 'reduction' data structure.
........
  r9543 | bugman | 2009-09-18 19:20:15 +0200 (Fri, 18 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  The 'reduction' data structure is now properly created from the XML file.
........
  r9544 | bugman | 2009-09-21 13:25:14 +0200 (Mon, 21 Sep 2009) | 6 lines
  
  Modified the frame order grid search.
  
  The angle end points are now avoided (as they are the same as the start 
points) and the beta Euler
  angle increments are halved, as the search is half of that of alpha and 
gamma (0 to pi).
........
  r9545 | bugman | 2009-09-21 13:53:39 +0200 (Mon, 21 Sep 2009) | 5 lines
  
  Removed the end point of the cone angle from the grid search.
  
  This is unrestricted motion, so is physically not possible.
........
  r9546 | bugman | 2009-09-21 14:03:55 +0200 (Mon, 21 Sep 2009) | 5 lines
  
  Also halved the number of theta polar angle increments in the frame order 
grid search.
  
  This is to match the cone axis azimuthal angle phi.
........
  r9547 | bugman | 2009-09-21 16:20:58 +0200 (Mon, 21 Sep 2009) | 6 lines
  
  Fix for the missing PDB file error.
  
  The extension '.pdb' was being added to the end so if the missing file 
'1F3Y.pdb' was specified,
  the RelaxError would say that '1F3Y.pdb.pdb' was missing.
........
  r9548 | bugman | 2009-09-21 18:44:14 +0200 (Mon, 21 Sep 2009) | 7 lines
  
  Complete redesign of the grid_search() method.
  
  The grid ops structure is no longer created, rather the grid is directly 
created to be passed to the
  grid search algorithm.  The __grid_row() method has been added to create 
the row of the grid
  corresponding to a certain parameter.
........
  r9549 | bugman | 2009-09-21 19:37:50 +0200 (Mon, 21 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Implemented the acos grid search for angular parameters of the frame order 
theories.
........
  r9550 | bugman | 2009-09-21 19:39:41 +0200 (Mon, 21 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Fixed the call to the grid search.

  Fix for the __unpack_opt_results() for the new direct calling of the grid 
search.
  
  The returned results are different.
........
  r9552 | bugman | 2009-09-22 11:50:31 +0200 (Tue, 22 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Added a false, deliberately broken Xplor line to test the parsing of Xplor 
NOE files.

  r9553 | bugman | 2009-09-22 12:04:37 +0200 (Tue, 22 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Bug fix for the reading of Xplor NOE data when a line starts with '#'.
........
  r9554 | bugman | 2009-09-22 13:15:40 +0200 (Tue, 22 Sep 2009) | 5 lines
  
  Fix for the test_opt_rigid_rand_rot() system test.
  
  The changes to the frame order grid search broke this test.

  r25790 | bugman | 2014-09-12 15:05:07 +0200 (Fri, 12 Sep 2014) | 13 lines
  
  Added support for the model argument for the frame_order.pdb_model user 
function.
  
  This argument is used to specify which of the models in an ensemble will be 
used to represent the
  average domain position Monte Carlo simulations, as each simulation is 
encoded as a model, as well
  as for the distribution of structures simulating the motion of the system.  
The argument is
  therefore passed into the create_ave_pos() and create_distribution() 
functions of the
  specific_analyses.frame_order.geometric module.
  
  To handle all models being used in the non Monte Carlo simulation PDB file 
and only one in this
  file, the internal structural object is copied twice.  The second copy for 
the MC sims has all but
  the chosen model deleted out of it.
........
  r25791 | bugman | 2014-09-12 15:19:16 +0200 (Fri, 12 Sep 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Fix for the Frame_order.test_frame_order_pdb_model_ensemble system test.
  
  More needed to be done to set up the Monte Carlo simulations - the 
monte_carlo.initial_values user
  function call was required.
........
  r25792 | bugman | 2014-09-12 15:20:32 +0200 (Fri, 12 Sep 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Modified the frame order sim_init_values() API method to handle missing 
optimisation data.
  
  The monte_carlo.initial_values user function was failing if optimisation 
had not been performed.
  This is now caught and handled correctly.
........
  r25794 | bugman | 2014-09-12 15:30:26 +0200 (Fri, 12 Sep 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Created the Frame_order.test_frame_order_pdb_model_failed_pivot system test.
  
  This simply shows how the frame_order.pdb_model user function currently 
fails if the optimised pivot
  point is outside of the PDB coordinate limits of &quot;%8.3f&quot;.
........
  r25795 | bugman | 2014-09-12 15:45:45 +0200 (Fri, 12 Sep 2014) | 11 lines
  
  The frame_order.pdb_model user function can now properly handle a failed 
pivot optimisation.
  
  This is when the pivot point optimises to a coordinate outside of the PDB 
limits.
  
  Now all calls to specific_analyses.frame_order.data.generate_pivot() from 
the module
  specific_analyses.frame_order.geometric set the pdb_limit flag to True.  
This allows all
  representation objects to be within the PDB limits.  The algorithm in 
generate_pivot() has been
  extended to allow higher positive values, as the real PDB limits are 
[-999.999, 9999.999].  And a
  RelaxWarning is called when the pivot is outside to tell the user about it.
........
  r25796 | bugman | 2014-09-12 15:59:00 +0200 (Fri, 12 Sep 2014) | 17 lines
  
  Reverted r25767 as this was rubbish, the frame_order.pivot user function 
updates the model itself.
  
  The command used was:
  svn merge -r25767:r25766 .
  
  .....
    r25767 | bugman | 2014-09-12 10:08:13 +0200 (Fri, 12 Sep 2014) | 6 lines
    Changed paths:
       M /branches/frame_order_cleanup/specific_analyses/frame_order/uf.py
    
    Added a call to check_pivot() to the frame_order.select_model user 
function.
    
    This is to prevent this user function from being called before the pivot 
has been set, as otherwise
    the parameter vector will be incorrectly set up.
  .....
........
  r25797 | bugman | 2014-09-12 16:06:38 +0200 (Fri, 12 Sep 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Modified the frame order auto-analysis to be more fail-safe.
  
  Almost all of the protocol is now within a try-finally block so that the 
execution lock will always
  be released.
........
  r25798 | bugman | 2014-09-12 16:50:28 +0200 (Fri, 12 Sep 2014) | 7 lines
  
  Fix for the specific_analyses.frame_order.data.pivot_fixed() function.
  
  This was recently introduced (r25763) when the check for PCS data was 
removed from this function.
  To fix the problem, instead of calling base_data_types() to see if PCS data 
is present, the
  cdp.pcs_ids data structure is checked instead.
........
  r25799 | bugman | 2014-09-12 16:55:53 +0200 (Fri, 12 Sep 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Fix for the model argument for the frame_order.pdb_model user function.
  
  The deletion of structural models for the Monte Carlo simulations in the 
average domain position
  representation now only happen if more than one model exists.
........
  r25804 | bugman | 2014-09-12 17:10:55 +0200 (Fri, 12 Sep 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Modified the Frame_order.test_frame_order_pdb_model_failed_pivot system 
test.
  
  This is to show that the frame_order.pdb_model user function fails if the 
pivot is close to but
  still within the PDB coordinate limits.
........
  r25805 | bugman | 2014-09-12 17:13:19 +0200 (Fri, 12 Sep 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Modified the pivot position checking in 
specific_analyses.frame_order.data.generate_pivot().
  
  Now the pivot is shifted to be within the limits shrunk by 100 Angstrom.  
This allows any PDB
  representation created by the frame_order.pdb_model user function to be 
within the PDB limits.
........
  r25806 | bugman | 2014-09-12 17:21:08 +0200 (Fri, 12 Sep 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Fix for the axis permutation protocol in the frame order auto-analysis.
  
  If a results file was found for one of the permutations, a return from the 
function would occur.
  The result is that the other permutations would not be loaded or optimised.
........
  r25807 | bugman | 2014-09-12 17:31:20 +0200 (Fri, 12 Sep 2014) | 5 lines
  
  Fix for the RelaxError raised by the frame_order.select_model user function.
  
  This is the error if the model name is incorrect.
........
  r25808 | bugman | 2014-09-12 17:33:54 +0200 (Fri, 12 Sep 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Created the Frame_order.test_pseudo_ellipse_zero_cone_angle system test.
  
  This is to catch for a bug in optimisation when the cone_theta_x is set to 
zero in the
  pseudo-ellipse models.
........
  r25809 | bugman | 2014-09-12 17:35:47 +0200 (Fri, 12 Sep 2014) | 7 lines
  
  Bug fix for the lib.frame_order.pseudo_ellipse.tmax_pseudo_ellipse_array() 
function.
  
  The problem was that when theta_x or theta_y were zero, the floating point 
value of 0.0 would be
  returned.  This is the incorrect behaviour as the returned value must be an 
array matching the
  dimensions of the phi angle array argument.
........
  r25811 | bugman | 2014-09-12 18:07:20 +0200 (Fri, 12 Sep 2014) | 5 lines
  
  Fix for the Pseudo_elliptic cone object for when the cone angles are zero.
  
  The Pseudo_elliptic.phi_max() method now avoids a divide by zero error.
........
  r25812 | bugman | 2014-09-12 18:42:47 +0200 (Fri, 12 Sep 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Updates for all of the Frame_order.test_axis_perm_* system tests.
  
  The axis permutations and angle permutations are now performed correctly 
within the tests
  themselves.  This allows the tests to pass.
........
  r25813 | bugman | 2014-09-12 19:03:09 +0200 (Fri, 12 Sep 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Modified the Frame_order.test_pseudo_ellipse_zero_cone_angle system test to 
be quick.
  
  Now that the test passes, the optimisation needs to be short.  So a maximum 
of two iterations are
  now set.  Otherwise the test would take hours to complete.
........
  r25814 | bugman | 2014-09-12 19:22:19 +0200 (Fri, 12 Sep 2014) | 3 lines
  
  Small speed up of the Frame_order.test_auto_analysis system test.
........
  r25815 | bugman | 2014-09-14 11:33:37 +0200 (Sun, 14 Sep 2014) | 3 lines
  
  Alphabetical ordering of most of the Frame_order system tests.
........
  r25816 | bugman | 2014-09-14 11:39:14 +0200 (Sun, 14 Sep 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Created the very simple Frame_order.test_num_int_points system test.
  
  This simply creates a data pipe and calls the frame_order.num_int_pts user 
function to test its
  operation.  This is to increase the test suite coverage of this user 
function.
........
  r25817 | bugman | 2014-09-14 11:54:58 +0200 (Sun, 14 Sep 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Created the Frame_order.test_num_int_pts2 system test.
  
  This checks the operation of the frame_order.num_int_pts user function when 
only the model has been
  chosen.
........
  r25818 | bugman | 2014-09-14 12:01:49 +0200 (Sun, 14 Sep 2014) | 3 lines
  
  Renamed the Frame_order.test_num_int_points system test to 
Frame_order.test_num_int_pts.
........
  r25819 | bugman | 2014-09-14 12:48:27 +0200 (Sun, 14 Sep 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Created the check_domain() function for the frame order analysis.
  
  This is in the specific_analyses.frame_order.checks module.  The function 
checks that the reference
  domain has been specified.
........
  r25820 | bugman | 2014-09-14 12:56:20 +0200 (Sun, 14 Sep 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Created the check_model() function for the frame order analysis.
  
  This is in the specific_analyses.frame_order.checks module.  The function 
checks that the frame
  order model has been selected via the frame_order.select_model user 
function.
........
  r25821 | bugman | 2014-09-14 12:58:39 +0200 (Sun, 14 Sep 2014) | 3 lines
  
  Fixes for the new check_domain() and check_model() frame order functions.
........
  r25822 | bugman | 2014-09-14 13:01:01 +0200 (Sun, 14 Sep 2014) | 3 lines
  
  The frame_order.ref_domain user function backend now uses the 
check_domain() function.
........
  r25823 | bugman | 2014-09-14 13:13:40 +0200 (Sun, 14 Sep 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Created the check_parameters() function for the frame order analysis.
  
  This is in the specific_analyses.frame_order.checks module.  The function 
checks that the frame
  order parameters have been set up and have values.
........
  r25824 | bugman | 2014-09-14 13:14:51 +0200 (Sun, 14 Sep 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Created the Frame_order.test_num_int_pts3 system test.
  
  This checks the operation of the frame_order.num_int_pts user function when 
the model has been and
  the frame order parameters have been set up.
........
  r25825 | bugman | 2014-09-14 13:22:08 +0200 (Sun, 14 Sep 2014) | 7 lines
  
  Created the Frame_order.test_count_sobol_points system test.
  
  This will test that the frame_order.num_int_pts user function can correctly 
count the number of
  Sobol' integration points used for the current set of parameter values.  
This
  frame_order.num_int_pts functionality does not exist yet.
........
  r25826 | bugman | 2014-09-14 14:43:07 +0200 (Sun, 14 Sep 2014) | 7 lines
  
  Implementation of the 
specific_analyses.frame_order.optimisation.count_sobol_points() function.
  
  This is used by the frame_order.num_int_pts user function to provide a 
printout of the number of
  Sobol' integration points used for the current parameter values.  This is 
to provide user feedback
  so that it is know if enough Sobol' points have been used.
........
  r25827 | bugman | 2014-09-14 14:44:49 +0200 (Sun, 14 Sep 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Modified the Frame_order.test_count_sobol_points system test.
  
  The number of points has been massively decreased as generating Sobol' 
points takes a long time, and
  the check for the number of used Sobol' points has been set to the real 
value.
........
  r25828 | bugman | 2014-09-14 14:46:58 +0200 (Sun, 14 Sep 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Created the Frame_order.test_count_sobol_points2 system test.
  
  This checks the operation of the frame_order.count_sobol_points user 
function.  As this user
  function has not been implemented yet, the test currently fails.
........
  r25829 | bugman | 2014-09-14 14:56:40 +0200 (Sun, 14 Sep 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Created the frame_order.count_sobol_points user function.
  
  This is simply a frontend to the new 
specific_analyses.frame_order.optimisation.count_sobol_points()
  function.
........
  r25830 | bugman | 2014-09-14 14:57:04 +0200 (Sun, 14 Sep 2014) | 3 lines
  
  Updated the Frame_order.test_count_sobol_points2 system test for the 
correct number of Sobol' points.

  Created the Frame_order.test_count_sobol_points_rigid system test.
  
  This is to demonstrate a failure of the frame_order.test_count_sobol_points 
user function when
  applied to the rigid frame order model.
........

  Fix for the frame_order.count_sobol_points user function for the rigid 
model.
  
  This model is now caught at the start, a message printed out, and the 
function exited.

  Fix for the Frame_order.test_count_sobol_points_rigid system test.
  
  This now checks that cdp.used_sobol_points does not exist for the rigid 
frame order model after a
  call to the frame_order.count_sobol_points user function.

  The frame order count_sobol_points() function is now being called by all of 
minimise user functions.
  
  This occurs at the end of the minimise.calculate, minimise.grid_search, and 
minimise.execute user
  function backends to provide more feedback to the user as to the quality of 
the optimisation.  To
  avoid initialising the target function twice, the count_sobol_points() 
function now accepts the
  initialised target function as an optional argument.

  Fix for the frame_order.count_sobol_points user function for the free-rotor

  Fix for the frame order count_sobol_points() function.
  
  The checks for the model, parameter and domain set up must come first, 
before cdp.model is accessed.
  Otherwise the frame_order.num_int_pts user function will often fail.

  Fix for the frame order count_sobol_points() function.
  
  The free-rotor isotropic cone model was incorrectly handled, as the cone 
parameter is 'cone_s1' and
  not 'cone_theta'.  The order parameter is now converted to angle before 
checking if the Sobol' point
  is outside of the cone or not.

  Redesigned the frame_order.num_int_pts user function frontend for the 
oversampling idea.
  
  The use of the quasi-random Sobol' sequence for numerical PCS integration 
will be modified to use
  the concept of oversampling.  Instead of specifying the exact number of 
points in the Sobol'
  sequence and then removing points outside of the current parameter values, 
the algorithm will
  oversample as N * Ov * 10**M, where N is the maximum number of Sobol' 
points to be used for the
  integration, Ov is the oversampling factor, and M is the number of 
dimensions or torsion-tilt angles
  used in the system.  The aim is to try to use the maximum number of points 
N for all frame order
  models and all ranges of dynamics.

  Renamed the frame_order.num_int_pts user function to 
frame_order.sobol_setup.
  
  The user function no longer specifies the number of integration points.  
Instead it now specifies
  the maximum number of points N and oversampling factor Ov used to generate 
the oversampled Sobol'
  sequence.

  Converted all of the specific_analyses.frame_order package to the Sobol' 
point oversampling design.
  
  The correct values are now sent into the target function and all references 
to cdp.num_int_pts has
  been replaced with the cdp.sobol_max_points and cdp.sobol_oversample pair 
of variables.
  
  The frame_order.count_sobol_points user function backend has also been 
updated to show the total
  number of oversampling points and the number of points used.

  The frame_order.count_sobol_points user function now shows more information.
  
  The maximum number and oversampling factors are now also printed out for 
maximum user feedback.

  The frame order target function now passes the maximum number of Sobol' 
points to the relax library.
  
  The value is being passed into the lib.frame_order.*.pcs_numeric_int_*() 
functions, though it is not
  used set.

<pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi,

I think it would be worth creating a temporary branch for this.  I now
have the new GUI running almost perfectly on GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and
MS Windows (that was a huge effort :S), and will hopefully make a new
release very soon.  The changing of the IO streaming will likely break
relax for a little while, until all redirections are found and
modified for a new system.  The new release will have the mpi4py
multi-processor fabric working in prompt/scripting mode, and the GUI
running on the uni-processor fabric.  A second release could have the
mpi4py fabric running together with the GUI.

I would suggest placing the new code into the relax_io module, as this
already has the code for logging, teeing, and splitting IO streams.
What do you think about the concept of sinks?  We could have the
Multiplex_IO class handle multiple streams (more than 2, 3, etc), i.e.
split the stdout stream into two, and then send it to two sinks - the
terminal or test suite sink, and the relax controller.  There could be
filters applied to the streams, either prior to or after the split.
And the filters could be ordered, i.e. we create an IO processing
pipe, just like a piping in a shell.  I don't know if we need the
merger of streams though.  This is currently used by the mpi4py fabric
to send the IO from slaves to the terminal, but I would suggest we
keep the IO streams separate (or interleaved to preserve order), and
send this back to the master for post-processing.

Cheers,

Edward

Hi,

I have to say, that the ideas in the Multiplex_IO look great and would
be good to incorporate into relax at some point in the future.  The
ideas could be evolved a little more and turned into a module for IO
manipulation.  This could implement filters (pre or post pending text,
or any other operation) - i.e. the calling code could add a filter
function to a queue of filters.  And it could handle splitting and
merging of streams.  It could turn out to be very powerful.  It's a
real pity something like this does not exist in Python already!  I
would suggest tackling the slave IO capture problem first, and then
this one later on.

Regards,

Edward

Hi Edward

I thinks both should be compatible as discussed in my previous mailing so I
will go ahead with the design. My Intention is to have a general io return
interface methodology and then implement a class to do it so ensuring
independence of implementation..

I will most probably try and implement a set of unit tests first...

regards
gary

The second problem is IO redirection.  This occurs in a number of
places in relax.  These include:

1)  The --log command line flag which causes STDOUT and STDERR to be
sent to file.

2)  The --tee command line flag which causes STDOUT and STDERR to be
sent both to file and to the terminal.

3)  The test suite.  The STDOUT and STDERR streams are caught and only
sent to STDERR if there is an error or failure in a test.

4)  The relax controller (part of the GUI).  This is a window to which
STDOUT and STDERR are directed.  In the test-suite mode, the streams
also output to the terminal.

5)  The multi-processor package.  There are two parts.  The first is
essentially a pre-filter which prepends certain tokens to the IO
stream (i.e. the 'M  |', 'M  E|', and 'S 1|' text).  I cannot see how
we can do this as 4) is always set up after 5).  So I am considering
removing this part.  It will make it more difficult with debugging,
but I can see no other way.

6)  The second part for the multi-processor package, which is
currently non-functional, is the catching of the IO streams of the
slave processes to send back to the master.  I will try to mimic the
relax controller code here and store all slave text as a list with
flags specifying whether it is STDOUT or STDERR.  Then the list can be
returned to the master at which point the text can be sent to the two
streams.

The problem is that at each point here, sys.stdout and sys.stderr are
replaced and the order in which this happens is impossible to change.
Well 4) will always be last.

I think the problem here is that the whole idea of replacing the std io
streams multiple times is inflexible and painful.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

This is true.  Python, like many programing languages, does not handle
IO streams very nicely.  It would be good if you could set up some
processing pipe for the IO stream, but this looks very complicated to
implement.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">So I have come up with a
strawman multiplexed io implimentation. The idea is that you replace
stdio
and stderr once and then insert IO elements to deal with the needs to
block
the output of io streams, record them and  create Tees etc  see what you
think? Should we open a couple of new mail threads to discuss these
things?
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Lets see how it goes.  But we may need a few new threads.  For your
code below, it looks like it could be a the start of a solution.  The
question is, how do we design this so that the multi-processor package
is not dependent on relax?  Should the Multiplex_IO object be part of
relax, or the multi package?  I think that the main program should
have full control over the IO streams, and that the multi-processor
package should use what is available to it.  One problem here is that
a program could change the IO streams in mid operation.  For example
if I was to implement a function in the GUI which activates logging.
The Python program, as is with relax, could have many, many places
where IO streams are manipulated.  So it would be more beneficial to
have an IO stream manipulation framework within the main program.  The
multi-processor only needs to prepend text and capture slave IO
streams.

Maybe an alternative would be to capture and store the IO streams only
on the slaves?  This could be a fabric-specific implementation.  For
example the uni-processor would not touch the streams.  It would not
look as nice, but this would solve all the issues.  The slave IO
streams are captured, the 'S 1 |', 'S 2 |', etc. text would be
prepended, the text sent back to the master via the memo objects, and
then the master can send it to what ever sys.stdout and sys.stderr are
currently set to by the calling Python program.  As I mentioned
before, the slave's STDOUT and STDERR order can be preserved by
storing it all in a list whereby the IO stream is identified by a
flag, as is done in the relax controller GUI window.  For example if
you have in a slave:

sys.stdout.write('test\n')
sys.stderr.write('fail\n')

Then the object passed to the master via the memo could look like:

io =[
 ['S 1 | test\n', 0],
 ['S 2 | fail\n', 1]
]

Then on the master:

for line, stream in io:
   if stream == 0:
       sys.stdout.write(line)
   else:
       sys.stderr.write(line)

This means that the two slave streams are merged, and then split again
by the master, preserving their order.  What do you think the overhead
of such an operation would be?  My guess would be only a few
milliseconds per slave process, as most of the work would be on the
master.  I would guess that the overhead should be similar to the
current prependIO code.  Only touching IO streams from the slaves
created by the multi-processor framework would not clash with any IO
manipulations the main program could ever imagine to do.

Regards,

Edward

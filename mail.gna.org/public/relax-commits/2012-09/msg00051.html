Log:
Added more text to describe the consistency testing approach.

Also includes a very basic point by point protocol for consistency testing.

This was proposed by by Edward d'Auvergne at:

 \section{Visualisation and data output}
+\label{sec: Visualisation and data output}
 
 The rest of the script is used to output the results to 2D Grace files for 
visualisation (the \uf{grace.view} user function calls will launch Grace with 
the created files), and the output of the values into plain text files.
 
 However, simply visualizing the calculated $J(0)$, $F_\eta$, and $F_{R_2}$ 
values this way does not allow proper consistency testing. Indeed, for 
assessing the consistency of relaxation data using these tests, different 
methods exist to compare values calculated from one field to another.  These 
include correlation plots and histograms, and calculation of correlation, 
skewness and kurtosis coefficients.
+
+To complete the consistency testing analysis, the following steps are needed:
+
+\begin{itemize}
+\item Extract the $J(0)$ values at multiple magnetic fields.
+\item Join together the data from a pair of magnetic fields either by 
pasting them as two columns of one file (approach A), or by dividing values 
from a first magnetic field by values from a second magnetic field (approach 
B).
+\item Make either a correlation plot (approach A), or an histogram of the 
ratios (approach B).
+\item See if the correlation plot is centered around a perfect correlation 
or skewed away (approach A), or if the values are centered around 1 in the 
histogram (approach B).  If yes, data from multiple magnetic fields is 
consistent from one magnetic field to another.  If no, data is inconsistent.  
In the case where inconsistency arises, if data from more than two magnetic 
fields is avaliable, more than one pair of data can be checked and the 
inconsistent magnetic field data can be identified.
+\end{itemize}
 
 An example of such an analysis is shown in Figure \ref{fig: consistency 
analysis} below
 
 \begin{figure*}[h]

plot of the calculated $J(0)$ values (top) as well as an histogram of the

+\caption[Example of consistency testing visual analysis]{Example of

plot of the calculated $J(0)$ values (approach A, top) as well as an 
histogram of the ration of calculated $J(0)$ values (approach B, bottom) are 
shown. Data from \citep{MorinGagne09b} is used for the purpose of this 
example.}
 \end{figure*}
 
+As shown in Figure \ref{fig: consistency analysis}, the example data 
displays both consistent and inconsistent data. In fact, data recorded at 500 
MHz and 600 MHz are consistent together, whereas data recorded at 800 MHz is 
not consistent with data recorded at 500 MHz nor 600 MHz.  Since more than 
two magnetic fields were used, this allowed the identification of the data 
from 800 MHz  as the inconsistent data, as data from 500 MHz is consistent 
with data from 600 MHz, and vice-versa.  In this particular example, this 
allowed the authors to take special care with data at 800 MHz.
+
+This inconsistency of 800 MHz data is seen on the correlation plot (toop) by 
a deviation from the dotted line (which represents the theoretical situation 
when equal $J(0)$ values are extracted from both magnetic fields. It is also 
observable in the histogram (bottom) where the ration of the data from two 
magnetic fields is not centered around 0. In fact, there seems to be a 
systematic shift of the calculated $J(0)$ values at 800 MHz when compared to 
the two other magnetic fields. This is caused by a similar shift in the 
experimental $R_2$ (transversal relaxation rate) data.
+
+For the 500 MHz and 600 MHz data pair, the data are centered around the 
dotted line in the correlation plot (approach A, top left) as well as 
centered around a value of 1 in the histogram comparing the ratios of values 
from both magnetic fields (approach B, bottom left). Of course, there are 
some outsider values even in the case of consistent data. There are caused by 
specific dynamic characteristics of these spins and are different from 
systematic inconsistencies such as depicted in the example above with the 
data recorded at 800 MHz.

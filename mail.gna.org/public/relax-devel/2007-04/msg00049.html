The scaling is looking awesome!  Obviously the MC sims will need work
and other tests will be required.  But the functionality of the branch
is looking very promising and exciting.  I have more responses below.

Please expect to have delayed responses to the previous messages.  I
will respond to your posts Gary, but I'm three days away from leaving
Australia and am flat out organising and packing.  I'll then be
spending a week in London before heading to Germany.  It could be a
few weeks before I'll be able to properly response to posts.

 Dear All
     I have now had a chance to do some true multi tasking on our local 
cluster with real overhead from intreprocess communication and the results 
are as follows

 processors     min     eff     mc      eff     grid    eff
 1              18      100     80      100     134     100
 2              9       100
 4              5       90
 8              3       75
 16             1       112.5
 32             1       56.25   8       31.25   4       104.6


 and the picture that speaks 1000 words

</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

It would be interesting to see if the efficiencies all converge to
100% when a larger number of spin systems are minimised.  Maybe
duplicating the data a number of times creating an artificially large
protein would be useful in that regard.

</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Do you mean the spheroid (axially symmetric) or the ellipsoid, as both
are anisotropic?  I would recommend increasing the number of steps in
this grid search if MPI is running.  With that type of scaling
efficiency, I would recommend 11 or 21 increments per dimension on a
32 processor cluster.  A drop from 134 min to 4 min is huge!

They should be more than accurate enough for these types of comparison.

For now statistics are unnecessary.

 3. timings were rounded to 1 second, so for example we must consider data 
points for  more than 16 processors for the min run to be suspect
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

That would explain the 56% efficiency for 32 processors.



</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">
 The results also highlight up some interesting considerations

 1 our local cluster has very poor disk io, with the result that when i first 
ran the calculations I saw no multiprocessor imporvements on the min run (in 
actual fact it got worse!) I got round this for this crude test by switching 
off virtually all text output from the various minimisation commands. Now 
obviously this isn't a long term solution but I can thing of other methods 
e.g  using an output thread thread on the master or output batching that 
would improve these results.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Both options sound good.  This type of threading is not very
complicated, although debugging blocked threads is hell.  Sending the
minimisation print out in one hit at the end would be very useful as
well.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">
 2. comparison of the results from the grid calculation and the other 
calculations are quite informative. clearly the grid results are excellent. I 
believe this is because I am returning individual subtask results to the 
master as they complete and the  resulting overhead due to waiting for the 
master is a problem. To make this (clearer?) here is an example: in  the case 
of the mc run I will take the 256 mc runs and distribute a batch of 8 to each 
processor (in the case of a 32 processor run) I then resturn the results 
individually as they complete I believe this can lead to access to the master 
being the bottleneck (this is most probably due to output ovrehead on stdout  
 again, though problems with contention due to coherence of the calculation 
length could also be a problem ).
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

In the Monte Carlo simulations, all of the output of the minimisations
is suppressed.  Therefore the sending of the minimisation print out
shouldn't be the issue as nothing needs to be sent.  There must be
something else at play.  Finding out what this is exactly is important
before an investment into the threading or batching is made.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">
In the case of the grid there are no subtasks  as the grid is almost ideally 
sub divided by processor so only one task is run on each slave.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Do the MC sims have the same scaling efficiency if only one simulation
is sent to each processor at once?  Does the efficiency increase or
decrease?


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">
I can see at least two answers to this. One is to batch the return of results 
so all results get returned at once and the second is to have an output 
thread on  the master separate from the thread ervicing mpi calls so 
processing of  returned data doesn't block the master and thus the rest of 
the cluster.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

As I mentioned above, both would be useful.  However it would be good
to know which will be the most beneficial for increasing efficiency
before implementation.  It could be that the one or the other will not
result in any significant improvements.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">
 I have some more comments to follow on the design of the current 
minimisation interface, how text output from the commands is controlled, and 
unit testing but these will have to follow in another message later on

displays perfectly.  I've been thinking about how you could release an
MPI relax version prior to the merging of a patch into the 1.3 line.
You could release a relax-1.3.0-gt version (gt for Gary Thompson).
This could itself have a few versions associated with it (I don't know
how they would be called though).  What do you think Gary?

Cheers,

Edward

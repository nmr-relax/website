  r17254 | bugman | 2012-07-16 12:02:30 +0200 (Mon, 16 Jul 2012) | 6 lines
  
  Bug fix for the RDC Q factor calculations for when the dipolar constants 
are not all the same.
  
  Now instead of a RelaxError, a warning is given and the Q factor normalised 
by 2Da^2(4 + 3R)/5 is
  skipped.  This allows long range and mixed nuclear pairs to be supported.
........
  r17255 | bugman | 2012-07-16 15:26:11 +0200 (Mon, 16 Jul 2012) | 5 lines
  
  Added the 'unit' argument to the dipole_pair.read_dist and 
dipole_pair.set_dist user functions.
  
  This is to allow distances in Angstroms to be read into relax and converted 
to meters.

........
  r17332 | bugman | 2012-08-15 16:38:48 +0200 (Wed, 15 Aug 2012) | 7 lines
  
  Redesign of how the GPL license is presented to the user.
  
  The old prompt.gpl module with the version 2 of the license has been 
deleted.  Now the text form the
  docs/COPYING file is passed through pydoc.pager for the './relax --licence' 
and the prompt mode GPL
  object, and is simply printed to STDOUT for the GUI help system.
........
  r17337 | bugman | 2012-08-27 11:05:17 +0200 (Mon, 27 Aug 2012) | 5 lines

versions!
........

  This has the form of 'uf: ' followed by the user function name, and is for 
referencing purposes
  within the main text.
........
  r17341 | bugman | 2012-08-27 11:55:55 +0200 (Mon, 27 Aug 2012) | 3 lines
  
  Added screenshots of Xmgrace displaying relaxation curves.

........
  r17344 | bugman | 2012-08-27 12:25:29 +0200 (Mon, 27 Aug 2012) | 5 lines

  This will be used for the relax manual where eps.gz files are required.
........
  r17345 | bugman | 2012-08-27 16:32:14 +0200 (Mon, 27 Aug 2012) | 6 lines
  
  Large expansion of the Oxygen icons within relax.

added as both PNG and gzipped
  EPS files.  A number of gzipped SVG icons has been added as well.
........
  r17346 | bugman | 2012-08-27 16:35:03 +0200 (Mon, 27 Aug 2012) | 6 lines
  
  Large expansion of the relax icon set.
  
  All 128x128 versions of the icons used by the user functions have been 
added as both PNG and gzipped

........
  r17347 | bugman | 2012-08-27 19:10:54 +0200 (Mon, 27 Aug 2012) | 9 lines
  
  Redesigned the formatting of the user function chapter of the relax manual.
  
  The fetch_docstrings.py now forces each user function to start in a new 
column.  This increases the
  size of the manual, but makes the reading of the user function 
documentation much easier.  The user
  function class and function icons (128x128 format) are now placed between 
the top bar and the 
  subsection title and are left and right justified.  This prettification 
simply allows the user
  functions to be more quickly identified.

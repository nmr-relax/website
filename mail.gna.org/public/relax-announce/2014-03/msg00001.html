<pre style="margin: 0em;">This is a minor feature and bugfix release which includes improvements
to the relaxation dispersion chapter of the manual and the addition of
new infrastructure for R1rho data handling in the dispersion analysis.
 More details are given below.

The new relax versions can be downloaded from
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nmr-relax.com/download.html">http://www.nmr-relax.com/download.html</a>.  If binary distributions are
not yet available for your platform and you manage to compile the
binary modules, please consider contributing these to the relax
project (described in section 3.6 of the relax manual,
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/relax_distribution_archives.html">http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/relax_distribution_archives.html</a>).

The full list of changes is:
    Features:
        * Large amounts of new infrastructure for the R1rho relaxation
dispersion analysis type.
        * More hardware information printed out when using the
'--info' command line option.
        * The user function relax_disp.write_disp_curves now produces
text files of R2eff verses the rotating frame tilt angle theta.
        * Small improvements for the relaxation dispersion GUI
tutorial and citation chapter of the relax manual.


    Changes:
        * Added text file for the articles reference values from the
global fit in Relax_disp.test_r1rho_kjaergaard.  Regarding bug #21344,

dataset with missing combinations of time and spin-lock field
strengths.  This is from optimisation of the Kjaergaard et al., 2013
Off-resonance R1rho relaxation dispersion experiments using the 'DPL'
model.  This uses the data from Kjaergaard's paper at DOI:
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi4001062">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi4001062</a>.

comparison with paper values, and will be turned off later to prevent
long running time.
        * Redid dict() keys for unit test of find_intensity_keys(), to
pass on Python 3.2 and 3.3.  Work in progress for Bug #21344,

        * The relax information printout, from &quot;relax -i&quot; for example,
now includes detailed CPU information.  This uses operating system
specific commands to obtain this information which is not available
from the platform Python module.
        * Removed the dependence on subprocess.check_output() as this
is only for Python 2.7 and higher.  This is for the relax information
printout about the CPU info recently introduced.
        * The RAM in the relax information printout is now displayed
for Mac OS X.  The 'sysctl' command is now being used to retrieve the
RAM size and total memory, and the swap is calculated as the
difference.
        * Added the OMP relaxation rates and compressed PDB file to
the repository.  This is to allow users to have a full data set to
perform a test model-free analysis with.
        * Added a sample_script to generate theta values for R1rho
data.  Regarding sr #3124, (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/support/?3124">https://gna.org/support/?3124</a>) - Grace

        * Created a new citation for relax which concatenates both the
d'Auvergne and Gooley 2008 papers.  This is to show to those who are
unaware of back-to-back paper concatenation rules how to cite both
papers using one reference, saving a lot of space.
        * Added lib.rotating_frame module containing functions related
to rotating frame NMR calculations.  Regarding sr #3124,

    Bugfixes:
        * Typo fix for text in the model-free GUI auto-analysis.  The
maximum iterations for the protocol was misspelled in the GUI.  This
was spotted by Hessam Nasrollah.
        * Fix for one of the frame order system tests when using the
Mac OS X application binary.  The problem was that the 'shared_data'
directory could not be found as it was not included in the test_suite
package __all__ list.
        * Fix for bug #21754 (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21754">https://gna.org/bugs/?21754</a>).  This is
the failure of the grace.view user function on MS Windows in opening a
file in qtgrace when the path includes spaces, as reported by Mengjun
Xue (mengjun dott xue att mailbox dott tu-berlin dott de).  The fix
was to run the program with the file name in double quotes.
        * Fix for bug #21763 (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21763">https://gna.org/bugs/?21763</a>).  This is
the problem of the chi2 value not being visible in the parameter list
of the grace.write and value.write user functions in the GUI.  The
problem was that when asking for the parameter name list, the
minimisation parameters were not being asked for.

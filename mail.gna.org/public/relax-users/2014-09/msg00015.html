<pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi Chung-ke.

You will be fine with numpy 1.6.2, as long as you stay in the
analytical models + &quot;NS 2-site expanded&quot;

If you would like to do the numerical models, &quot;NS 2-site 3D plus NS
2-site Star&quot;, you should try to get numpy 1.8.

This is because, that numpy 1.8 can handle linear algebra in 5
dimensional data array, and will be 5x faster.
When users only have 1.6, I had to make a hack by striding through the
data dimensions, and do the linear algebra matrix operations per
dimension.
That is 5x slower.

Troels

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Dear Edward and Troels,

Thank you for the additional info. So it seems that although cpmg_fit has 
the choice to use different R20’s, current literature is still limited to 
the R20A = R20B assumption. I actually have a copy of Korzhnev’s paper in 
my computer; will certainly take a closer look. I think my inexperience in 
the analysis is also a factor, and your information has been a huge help.

We already got 3.3.0 running, but it is still using an older version of 
numpy in our cluster. I know about canopy (in fact, I have it installed on 
my personal Mac), but last time I tried to install it on my personal 
account in the cluster computer, something went wrong and a lot of 
python-dependent stuff wouldn’t run. Since the system admin already gave 
his word that he will do his best to update our python system, I’ll just 
trust him… for now *grin*.

Cheers,

Chung-ke

PS: 3.3.0 does feel zippier than the older version, even using an old numpy 
(1.6.2?). The speed up is really impressive. Kudos to a job well done!

I actually now remember that I saw the R20A != R20B analysis presented
at a conference somewhere, though again I can't remember by whom.  I'm
pretty sure it was real data, very likely at 3 magnetic fields, and
possibly including multiple-quantum data as well, i.e. the MMQ models
in relax (<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/Category:MMQ_CPMG_data">http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/Category:MMQ_CPMG_data</a>).  I would
guess it was someone from the Kay, Palmer or Wright groups.  You will
probably not find the R20A = R20B assumption written in most papers,
as people just use the software blindly and don't realise that there
is a difference.  Most software have the R20A = R20B assumption
hardcoded so you have no choice.  The more advanced software from
Dmitry Korzhnev (cpmg_fit) allows you to fit these separately though.
You will however find the text about the assumption in pretty much all
of Dmitry's papers, for example in <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja054550e">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja054550e</a>
:

   &quot;The adjustable parameters for the &quot;global&quot; two-state model (F &lt;-&gt;
U) include nc‚nr‚nf intrinsic (transverse relaxation) R2 rates
(assumed to be the same in F and U states), ...&quot;

This is also well described in Art Palmer's 2001 Methods in Enzymology
review (<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0076-6879">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0076-6879</a>(01)39315-1).

P. S.  Troels' instructions for setting up your one Python and relax
installation is a great way to quickly have relax available,
especially if you wish to use a new version or the repository version
to obtain a quick bug fix.

Thank you for the thorough explanation. Yes, I now see why having the 
“full” models would be useful. I will try to track down the references 
you mentioned - I hope they are indexed in PubMed, I really have little 
idea on how to search for “pure” chemistry papers - and take a look at 
the scenarios where using the full models would be appropriate. I guess 
that I also need to re-read some of the literature on how to apply 
relaxation dispersion analysis to biological systems. The R20A = R20B 
assumption must be buried somewhere in the materials and methods section….

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi Chung-ke,

The aim of relax is to support absolutely every NMR dynamics theory in
existence!  For the relaxation dispersion analysis section of relax,
this means supporting all published models for the dispersion data,
and all parametric restrictions of these models.  Many of the
dispersion models have been derived with the assumption that R20A and
R20B are different, the Carver and Richards model is a good example of
this (<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/CR72_full">http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/CR72_full</a>).  These are the '* full'
models in relax.  However in the literature the parametric restriction
R20A = R20B (= R20) is almost always used.  For the analytic models
this can significantly simplify the equations, whereas for the numeric
models the equations do not change.  In both cases, two dimensions of
the the optimisation space collapse into one and the optimisation
problem massively simplifies.  That is why in relax we also provide
the collapsed models (those with the ' full' part of the label
removed).

It is true most literature data is not suitable for the '* full'
models.  That is why they are not turned on by default in the GUI or
listed in the sample scripts.  From memory though, there are cases
whereby the measured data is of high enough quality and collected on
enough magnets that the R20A != R20B assumption can be made.  I cannot
remember the reference(s), but it shouldn't be too hard to find.
Anyway, the full R20A != R20B models are provided in relax for a
number of reasons:

- The rare cases whereby the data is good enough.
- Academic studies.
- Future developments could significantly improve the quality of
measured dispersion data so that the R20A != R20B assumption can be
regularly made.
- Chemists have a different perspective on life compared to
biologists.  Small organic molecules make the R20A vs. R20B
distinction much, much easier.

I hope it is now clearer why there are these models in relax.

Edward

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Dear Edward and Troels,

Thank you all for the help! We are currently testing the new version of 
relax (yes, we are using the “normal” release), and making sure it 
plays along nicely with other software - we have a plethora of 
different python versions, which the system manager is doing his best 
to avoid interfering with each other. I am curious about one thing 
though: If the ‘CR72 full’ model has not been used in any published 
studies, then is there any reason to include it when trying to fit 
“real-world” data? It seems that Troels is implying that “real-world” 
data is too noisy to obtain meaningful fitting parameters from the 
model. Or am I misunderstanding something?

The only way to find out about new relax releases is the
relax-announce mailing list
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://news.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.announce">http://news.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.announce</a>).  Some relax
users were signed up for the freecode announcements
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://freecode.com/projects/nmr-relax">http://freecode.com/projects/nmr-relax</a>), but freecode has
unfortunately shut down (<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://freecode.com/about">http://freecode.com/about</a>).

For the version you are currently using, note that this is the
repository version of relax installed by the superuser.  You should
make sure you use the normal releases, as the repository version can
sometimes be in a broken or buggy state as development occurs.  You
can also have a copy in your home directory by typing:

$ svn co <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://svn.gna.org/svn/relax/trunk">http://svn.gna.org/svn/relax/trunk</a> ./relax-trunk
$ cd relax-trunk
$ scons

If you already have a repository version on your system, these
commands should just work.  But you should only use the repository
version if you would like a bug fix and cannot wait until the next
relax release.

Edward

Upon closer look at the R20 parameters, I think both of you are

Hi Chung-ke.

Can you put the information about which version of relax you use?

You can in terminal do:
relax -i

and write it here.

And then there is the question if you used data from one field or two
spectrometer fields.

Fitting to one field, can give problems.
This is described here:

&quot;&quot;&quot;Faithful estimation of dynamics parameters from CPMG relaxation
dispersion measurements.&quot;&quot;&quot;
Kovrigin, Evgenii L; Kempf, James G; Grey, Michael J; Loria, J Patrick
Journal of magnetic resonance, 2006, Vol 180, p 93-104.

DOI: 10.1016/j.jmr.2006.01.010

Figure 9 and 10 shows these &quot;rotten bananas&quot;.

Clustering data, in some way overcome this problem.
Since you now starts to add more data, compared to number of fitting
parameters.

The problem though, is that if you start from &quot;single fitted&quot; data,
and go to &quot;Clustering of data&quot;, that
an average of the global parameter will be taken for the single 
fitted data.

In previous version of relax (a version or two ago), we changed from
taking the average to take the median of the parameters.
This was to prevent taking the average of an outliers, if one of the
single fitted spins have been fitted &quot;crazy&quot;.
You don't want to start with a global kex at 10000.

I have discussed the CR72 Full model with my supervisor.
He have actually never seen it in use in any paper.
Always the assumption R20A=R20B is used.

If you only have one field, I would not even try this model.
If you still would like to try it, please consider using the B14 full
model as well, to compare.

Abstract: &quot;Faithful estimation of dynamics parameters from CPMG
relaxation dispersion measurements.&quot;
This work examines the robustness of fitting of parameters describing
conformational exchange (k(ex), p(a/b), and Deltaomega) processes from
CPMG relaxation dispersion data. We have analyzed the equations
describing conformational exchange processes for the intrinsic
inter-dependence of their parameters that leads to the existence of
multiple equivalent solutions, which equally satisfy the experimental
data. We have used Monte-Carlo simulations and fitting to the
synthetic data sets as well as the direct 3-D mapping of the parameter
space of k(ex), p(a/b), and Deltaomega to quantitatively assess the
degree of the parameter inter-dependence. The demonstrated high
correlation between parameters can preclude accurate dynamics
parameter estimation from NMR spin-relaxation data obtained at a
single static magnetic field. The strong parameter inter-dependence
can readily be overcome through acquisition of spin-relaxation data at
more than one static magnetic field thereby allowing accurate
assessment of conformational exchange properties.

Hi Chung-ke,

Welcome to the relax mailing lists!  Thanks to the hard work of one of
the relax developers - Troels Linnet - this long calculation time
should now be much, much shorter.  Have a look at the following
release announcement:

<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/Relax_3.3.0">http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/Relax_3.3.0</a>

For the 'CR72 full' model (<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/CR72_full">http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/CR72_full</a>), the
clustering example here gives a ~22x speed up so your calculation time
would then drop from ~20,000 min to ~1000 min.  If you would like to
receive announcements about new relax versions, please subscribe to
the relax-announce mailing list
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://mail.gna.org/listinfo/relax-announce/">https://mail.gna.org/listinfo/relax-announce/</a>).  This list only
receives ~10 emails per year.  See
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://news.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.announce">http://news.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.announce</a>.

I have a few questions about how you performed the analysis.  Did you
use a non-clustered set of results to seed the clustered analysis?  In
the dispersion auto-analysis protocol exposed via the GUI, the results
from the non-clustered analysis will be taken as the starting point
for optimisation of the clustered analysis, as described in Morin et
al., 2014 (<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btu166">http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btu166</a>).  If you
wish, and are capable with scripting, you can also create your own
analysis protocol via a relax script and not use the auto-analysis.
The relax software is very flexible and you can create quite complex
analysis protocols - the auto-analyses are just large relax scripts.

Also, did you look at the results from the non-clustered analysis to
see if the kinetics of all 13 residues are similar?  Or if the
dispersion curves look reasonable?  Some data might be of low quality
and causing difficulties with the optimisation.  You should also note
that most dispersion data is not good enough to differentiate R20A
from R20B.  Do the final results (non-clustered and clustered) look
reasonable for these two parameters?  It could be that differentiating
R20A from R20B in your system is difficult and causing optimisation to
take much longer than normal.  Do you see the same optimisation times
with the clustered CR72 model where R20A=R20B=R20
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/CR72">http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/CR72</a>)?  Also, have a look at the log file
from the analysis and see if the total number of minimisation
iterations is much longer for the 'CR72 full' model compared to the
CR72 model.  This will tell you if the optimisation problem is much
more complicated for the 'full' model.

Regards,

Edward

Dear all,

This is my first post here, and I have a question regarding the time 
it
takes for a relaxation dispersion clustering process to finish. I 
have one
clustering calculation that has been running for ~ 20,000 min on a 
single
Xeon 2.66 GHz core. The cluster consists of 13 residues being fit to 
the
‘CR72 full’ model. I wonder if the long time it is taking is normal? 
Would
it be possible that relax has been stuck in an infinite loop of some 
sort,
without showing up in the log file? Any input would be greatly 
appreciated.
By the way, using a cluster of only 11 residues out of the 13 did 
finish in
~13,000 min.

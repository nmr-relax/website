Hi Ed,<br>
<br>
Your comments are interesting... but nevertheless trouble me...<br>
<br>
I talked with the guy who makes the MD simulation with my protein. He
noticed that some NH vectors indeed have motions well defined by a cone
which is fine if we want to analyze things with the model-free
approach. However, some NH vectors have motions more like a stretched
cone (which is not surprising at all, since motions inside a protein
are restricted by the available space as long as with the position of
charges, etc), More worrying are some motions seen as two separate
cones, which is then bad, since an average position doesn't have any
meaning and can even be impossible due to steric or charge problems...<br>
<br>
Ok. The reason I would not use a crystallographic structure is that
maybe some NH vectors could be badly oriented because of packing
modifications in the crystal (at interfaces)... An NMR structure may be
better, but impossible for a lot of people, like me...<br>
<br>
But what does the individual NH vector orientation really affect ? Will
a different NH vector orientation give rise to a different selected
model or will it only affect model parameters ? Also, will some bad NH
vector orientations (let's say less than 10% bad orientations overall)
affect the global diffusion parameters ? In other words, will those
possibly bad orientations produce artifacts, like false Rex or modified
tm, for example ?<br>
<br>
Another question... The NH vectors are described by two coordinates
(for H and N) in the PDB files, but transformed to angles within relax
or any program alike (Am I right ?). Can a user directly input a set of
angles rather than coordinates ? I ask this because I'd like to try to
input average orientation which were computed to give a set of angles
rather than a modified PDB file... Are the coordinates necessary to
analyze the global diffusion (to assess the shape of the protein) ? Are
the angles only used for local motions analysis ?<br>
<br>
Thanks for the tips / opinions / comments / anything !<br>
<br>
Cheers<br>
<br>

  <pre wrap="">Hi,

I have to say that I am definitely not an expert in this subject.
When I have this issue I just use Molmol to add the protons, which I
would assume is based on ideal geometry.  For any simulation I would
guess that the proton will move around in and out of the peptide
plane.  So, if you can assume that this motion is accurately simulated
which, if done correctly, these fast motions should be then maybe the
average position would be the best for model-free analysis.

Be careful though because this is a whole can of worms you could be
opening here!  Model-free analysis (as well as many other theories in
the field) assumes in its theory that you have a defined bond vector
orientation but the analysis implies motion which in turn means the
vector moves again in turn changing the results of the analysis.  Note
the circular loop of dependence and the lack of theory addressing this
- this really is not an issue for the faint hearted!

Regards,

Edward

    <pre wrap=""> Hi Ed

 Thanks for the information about the relative PDB orientation and Euler
angles...

 For adding hydrogens to a PDB, I wonder what approach is best so that it
can be used (in relax) for non isotropic relaxation analysis. In other
words, what approach would be best to get good NH vector orientations ?

 I have a PDB at 1.95 A resolution and without any hydrogen. I tried two
different approaches to get the hydrogens in a good orientation...

 1.
 Hydrogens were added inside CHARMM and then a short Langevin minimization
(200 ps) was done.

 2.
 Hydrogens were added inside CHARMM (as for approach 1) and then a molecular
dynamics simulation was performed (by another PhD student) with TIP3P water
and 3 snapshots were taken at time 10, 12 and 14 ns (after 2 ns
equilibration)... I could take snapshots up to 40 ns, but they should be
equivalent to others...

 My questions :

 What approach do you think is the best to get good NH orientations ?

 Would it be relevant to take different snapshots from MD and use them in
separate relax runs ?

 Would you suggest another approach ?


 Cheers

 Hi,

The only differences in the analysis should be due to different bond
orientations. The PDB reference frame doesn't matter - this will only
change the values Euler angles of the diffusion tensor and nothing
else. So if the same structure exists in two different PDB frames,
then the difference in the optimised Euler angles will be solely due
to the rotation between the two structures. If you were to change the
PDB frame in any of your files, the final chi-squared value should be
identical to a non-rotated PDB. The differences you do see are
because the relative XH bond orientations in the different structures
are different.

Regards,

Edward

 Hi,

I am doing different tests with the full_analysis.py script, data at
three magnetic fields and different PDB structures (taken from MD
simulations).

I realized that those different structures give rise to different
optimization times and also to different chi-squared values for the
different diffusion tensors (I have only tried the prolate diffusion
tensor).

I wonder if the structures need to be processed before giving as inputs
for relax. Especially, do the structures need to be centered relative to
their inertia tensor (like with the pdbinertia program that one should
use prior to model-free analysis using ModelFree).

Thanks !

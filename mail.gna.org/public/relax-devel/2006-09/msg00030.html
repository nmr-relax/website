<br>&gt; tau_c)^ -2<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't know the specifics for proteins, but in pyrimidine bases (uracil<br>&gt; and<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; cytodine) and in the ribose rings, the C-C bond length are 134pm and
<br>&gt; 153pm<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;At 600 Mhz and as small as a 5 ns correlation time, the<br>&gt; CC<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; contributes ~13% to the R1 rate of the base relaxation and ~6% for the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; ribose.&nbsp;&nbsp;The CC rate is equal to the CH rate at a tau( c ) of ~14 ns for
<br>&gt; the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; base and ~20 ns for the ribose.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Can we handle this situation prior to model-free analysis?&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll read<br>&gt; &gt; the paper, as what I'm asking is quite likely to be answered there,
<br>&gt; &gt; but is it possible to tease out the auto-relaxation rate of the CH<br>&gt; &gt; carbon?&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence we input the pure R1 rate of the carbon (free of the CC<br>&gt; &gt; rate) into the model-free analysis and leave the current relaxation
<br>&gt; &gt; equations as they are?&nbsp;&nbsp;We could therefore completely ignore the CC<br>&gt; &gt; rate in the analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;That would significantly simplify the task of<br>&gt; &gt; coding.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So, you would propose taking the rate input by the user and (if the indicate
<br>&gt; in some way that it's uniformly labeled) just subtract any CC rates from it?<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure that's a good idea for a couple of reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;1) we would need<br>&gt; to know a priori what it's relaxation properties are (diffusion model,
<br>&gt; model-free model, correlation time, etc. that _expression_ I wrote is just an<br>&gt; approximation of the relation between CH and CC dipolar relaxation), and 2)<br>&gt; for larger molecules, the CC becomes the primary means of relaxation and so
<br>&gt; we would be ignoring the majority of the relaxation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Granted, except for<br>&gt; some sort of alkyne, the CC bond will be NOT parallel to the CH bond and<br>&gt; also lead into the complication you mention below.
<br><br>I thought that tc term (relax uses the tm notation) would be<br>problematic!&nbsp;&nbsp;Doh.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there an alternative equation (probably an<br>intermediate in it's derivation) in which the (<a href="http://w.tc">w.tc</a>)^2 term is
<br>replaced by J(w).&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm assuming that the intermediate equations depend<br>on J(w) and assumptions are made to replace it with (<a href="http://w.tc">w.tc</a>)^2.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you<br>did use J(w) instead, the equation would be much more accurate and it
<br>would be a lot easier to implement the equations into relax (as the<br>J(w) terms will already be calculated by the time you reach the R1,<br>R2, and NOE relaxation equations).&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, the tm value will be<br>accessible at that time as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the only benefit of using
<br>J(w) over (<a href="http://w.tc">w.tc</a>)^2 would be that no assumptions about the global<br>tumbling and internal motions are made.&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, now that I think a<br>little more about it, you would need the J(w) component parallel to
<br>the CC vector for each CC interaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;That would significantly<br>complicate the situation over the isotropic assumption of (<a href="http://w.tc">w.tc</a>)^2.<br>Forget I just wrote that paragraph!</blockquote><div>
<br>Ok ... paragraph forgotten :)&nbsp; One thing though.&nbsp; Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think of tau( c ) and tau( m ) interchangeably.&nbsp; In fact tau( e ), tau( f ), and tau( s ) are pretty much the same thing to me too.&nbsp; Just to be clear, the _expression_ I gave is a huge approximation and drops about 4 J(w) terms, keeping only the dominant one for D_cc and D_ch relaxation (J(0) and J(w_c) respectively).&nbsp; It also assumes (for J(w_c)) that (
<a href="http://w.tc">w.tc</a>)^2 &gt;&gt; 1, which is pretty true.&nbsp; The _expression_ is for a rigid interaction.<br>&nbsp;</div><br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">
Therefore it's obvious that the separation of the R1 rates is not<br>possible prior to analysis because it depends on the Brownian<br>rotational diffusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would therefore be useful to have an option<br>so that the user can select between uniform labelling and natural
<br>abundance when inputting the 13C R1 values.</blockquote><div><br>I agree.&nbsp; Also, for uniformly labeled, it would be useful to choose if the spin was detected selectively or not.&nbsp; If selective, one can use heteronuclear dipolar equations to calculate the relaxation rate.&nbsp; If nonselective (ie you hit both Ca and CO, or C5 and C6) then you need to use the homonuclear expressions for dipolar relaxation.
<br><br>a) R1 like spins:<br>0.1 d^2 [ 3 J(w_i) + 12 J(2 w_i) ]<br><br>b) R1 unlike spins (should be familiar):<br>0.1 d^2 [ J (w_i - w_s) + 3 J (w_i) + 6 J(w_i + w_s) ]<br><br>c) R1 of like spins, treated as unlike (selective excitation):
<br>0.1 d^2 [ J ( 0 ) + 3 J (w_i) + 6 J(2 w_i) ]<br><br>d = (mu0 * gam_i * gam_s * h)/(8 pi^2 * r^3)<br>J = extended model free<br><br>These I determined from using the Spiess reference I keep talking about :) [NMR Basic Principles and Progress (1978) 15, 55-214]
<br><br><br></div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Misc.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Then no, i'm not making that assumption.&nbsp;&nbsp;I calculate a different
<br>&gt; spectral<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; density for the two/three mechanisms ... is that a flaw in the way I'm<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; analyzing things?&nbsp;&nbsp;If so, I'm not sure I understand.&nbsp;&nbsp;It does say in<br>&gt; Spiess<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; that &quot;The [c_i] contain the coupling parameters delta_lambda and,
<br>&gt; therefore,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; are not spectral densities. ... It should be noted, however, that even<br>&gt; in<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; the general case, for the l = 2 terms, the coupling constant<br>&gt; delta_lambda<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; enters as a common factor .. and, therefore, reduced g_2,lambda =<br>&gt; g_2,lambda<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; / delta_lambda^2 are independent of the strength of the coupling and<br>&gt; only<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; depend on the assymetry parameter eta_lambda, a number between 0 and 1.&quot;
<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; guess, in this light, what I use are reduced spectral densities (?) or<br>&gt; is<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; that yet something else entirely?&nbsp;&nbsp;What affect does this have on what we<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; want to do?
<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Reduced spectral density mapping (Lefevre, J. F., Dayie, K. T., Peng,<br>&gt; &gt; J. W., and Wagner, G. (1996) Biochem, 35(8), 2674-2686), is where the<br>&gt; &gt; assumption J(wX-wH) = J(wH) = J(wX+xH), 
i.e. the three higher<br>&gt; &gt; frequency spectral densities, are equal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence you can map the R1,<br>&gt; &gt; R2, and NOE directly into the three spectral densities J(0), J(wX),<br>&gt; &gt; and J(~wH).<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spectral density mapping is an interesting approach to interpreting
<br>&gt; relaxation, but I've never been to keen on the idea.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; As for comprehending the problem, it's me who is the one who doesn't<br>&gt; &gt; fully understand!&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll try to explain what my perception currently
<br>&gt; &gt; is.&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly the model-free spectral density function is (the original<br>&gt; &gt; Lipari-Szabo formula)<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _k_<br>&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1 - S2)(te + ti)te&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\
<br>&gt; &gt; J(w)&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;ci . ti | ------------&nbsp;&nbsp;+<br>&gt; ------------------------- |,<br>&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;/__&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \ 1 + (w.ti)^2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (te + ti)^2 + ( w.te.ti)^2 /<br>&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i=-k<br>&gt; &gt;
<br>&gt; &gt; where ci are the weights and ti are the global correlation times of<br>&gt; &gt; the diffusion tensor.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that that equation doesn't get too<br>&gt; &gt; mangled!&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the formula used in relax.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a generic equation
<br>&gt; &gt; that handles all types of Brownian rotational diffusion of the<br>&gt; &gt; macromolecule - spherical (k = {0}), spheroidal (k = {-1, 0, 1}), and<br>&gt; &gt; ellipsoidal (k = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}).&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a numerically stabilised
<br>&gt; &gt; form of the equations used to prevent round-off errors.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I'll create a hypothetical, yet impossible, example in which the<br>&gt; &gt; model-free parameters would be different.&nbsp;&nbsp;It should illustrate my
<br>&gt; &gt; confusion ;)&nbsp;&nbsp;Say the DD interaction is perpendicular to the major<br>&gt; &gt; axis of the CSA interaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now construct a restricted motion which<br>&gt; &gt; stochastically rotates about the DD vector.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the spectral density
<br>&gt; &gt; function experienced by the DD interaction (J_DD(w)), the S2 value<br>&gt; &gt; would be 1 and te would be undefined (== statistically zero).&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet<br>&gt; &gt; the S2 value for the spectral density function parallel to the major
<br>&gt; &gt; axis of the CS tensor (J_CSA(w)) would not be one and the te value may<br>&gt; &gt; not be statistically zero.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; In model-free analysis, there are no assumptions about the internal<br>
&gt; &gt; motions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual model of the physical motion is not taken into<br>&gt; &gt; account, but you can map the Lipari-Szabo order parameter (and<br>&gt; &gt; effective correlation time) back onto a certain motion to define that
<br>&gt; &gt; motion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence isotropy in the internal motion is not important, you<br>&gt; &gt; only see the component of the motion parallel to the DD and CSA<br>&gt; &gt; interactions.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Is there an assumption in the theory that as J_DD(w) and J_CSA(w) are
<br>&gt; &gt; often close to parallel that you can assume J_DD(w) ~= J_CSA(w) and<br>&gt; &gt; hence S2_DD ~= S2_CSA and te_DD ~= te_CSA?&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see, I'm<br>&gt; &gt; completely lost.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I don't think you're completely lost at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;What you say is absolutely
<br>&gt; right and is at the crux of the assumption I make.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some, but not a<br>&gt; lot, of literature about the model free parameters derived from NH dipolar<br>&gt; relaxation vs other relaxation.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it has been shown that in
<br>&gt; ubiquitin, S2_csa = S2_dd, but it's not necessarily the case as you already<br>&gt; mentioned.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fundamentally, I like to think of a fully asymmetric CSA tensor<br>&gt; as having two main components orthogonal to one another.&nbsp;&nbsp;If one were able
<br>&gt; to measure CSA relaxation alone (no CH, no CC, no quadrupole, whatever :) )<br>&gt; the S2 and tau values report the on the motion of both components without<br>&gt; specific information on either orientation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The orientation of those two
<br>&gt; components almost guarantees that one will be significantly different from<br>&gt; the CH vector.&nbsp;&nbsp;In RNA bases, one component (the most shielded component) is<br>&gt; oriented orthogonal to the plane, while the other is usually between 5-30
<br>&gt; degrees from the CH orientation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hypothetical situation you represent,<br>&gt; in fact, isn't necessarily that impossible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nucleic acid bases undergo<br>&gt; internal wobbling motions that, I would assume, &quot;pivot&quot; about the hydrogen
<br>&gt; bonds or perhaps the glycosidic bond.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of pyrimidines, this<br>&gt; hydrogen bond pivoting would be close to your hypothetical situation for the<br>&gt; C6-H6 position (and the N-H)!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; As you can see, and I'm glad you understand the problem, this is the reason
<br>&gt; I said originally that the assumption that the order paramaters being the<br>&gt; same is likely not a good one, but a necessary one to begin with.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I<br>&gt; understand what you were saying about this also being a problem for
<br>&gt; isotropic diffusion and I think I agree with you that it should contribute<br>&gt; differently ... somehow. :)&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, with CC relaxation contributing,<br>&gt; it should also be sensitive to a different set of internal motions.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can
<br>&gt; only think of four ways to ultimately address this issue: 1) measure more<br>&gt; rates which contain the rate(s) of interest (C1q, C2q C1qC2q, CqNq, CqHq,<br>&gt; Hq, cross-correlated, cross relaxation) and expand model free to have S2_dd,
<br>&gt; S2_csa, S2_cc, etc. or 2) (and I hope I don't give away too much of some<br>&gt; future ideas) develop models similar to the gaussian axial fluctuation (GAF)<br>&gt; model used in proteins and fit rates using that instead of/in addition to
<br>&gt; ModelFree, 3) measure relaxation with and without uniform isotopic labelling<br>&gt; and expand model free as in 1), and 4) measure relaxation at tons of field<br>&gt; strengths and expand model free as in 1).&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these are, of course,
<br>&gt; incredibly complex and outside of the scope of what we currently would like<br>&gt; to accomplish.&nbsp;&nbsp;And as you already said, who knows if any of these<br>&gt; additional variations or components would be statistically significant, or
<br>&gt; even physically comprehensible.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In the short term, simply knowing this, we can expect that model free using<br>&gt; the assumption that the mechansims sense the same motions and have the same<br>&gt; model free parameters should decrease S2's and affect tau's as well,
<br>&gt; although I don't know if that would go up or down.&nbsp;&nbsp;I imagine that would<br>&gt; depend on the motion.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Now I think we're on the same page.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please let me know what you think about<br>&gt; all of this and if you can see any other problems/scenarios of interest.
<br><br>Got it!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I fully understand all the assumptions now.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, it<br>would be best to keep ideas for future work secret as these posts are<br>archived and will be Google searchable in a month or two - minimising
<br>the amount of info the competition has access to would be best<br>(assuming you have competition).&nbsp;&nbsp;I would guess that the resultant S2<br>would be closer to the true order parameter as you are measuring<br>spectral density functions in all three dimensions (x, y, z of the CS
<br>tensor) and approximating them by the single function J(w).&nbsp;&nbsp;Would<br>this mean that S2 ~= S2_DD * S2_CSA_parallel * S2_CSA_perpendicuar?&nbsp;&nbsp;I<br>haven't really put much thought into correlation functions and<br>spectral densities of rotational motions in all three dimensions and
<br>how they relate to the true order parameter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Model-free analysis of<br>the backbone N or C_alpha in proteins is essentially the motion of a<br>vector (due to the collinearity of the relaxation mechanisms) rather<br>than the motion of a tensor (which is probably a better description
<br>for non-collinear relaxation mechanisms).&nbsp;&nbsp;Interesting!</blockquote><div><br>I would imagine that S2_true = S2_x * S2_y * S2_z ~= S2_csa, if that makes any sense.&nbsp; I haven't given much thought to any relationships like that.
<br>&nbsp;</div><br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">Now that I think that I fully understand the problem, I should be able<br>to help with the implementation of the analysis techniques.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, I
<br>have one more question.&nbsp;&nbsp;How does the measured 13C R1 relate to the<br>rho(HC)/rho(CC) ratio (or ratios for each proximal 13C)?&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you need<br>to know rho(CC)?</blockquote><div><br>So, the measured R1 rate ( rho(C,auto) ) = rho(csa) + rho(CC dip) + rho(CH dip), assuming that all cross and cross-correlated relaxation is eliminated with the pulse sequence.&nbsp; Similarly, R2(C,auto) = R2(csa) + R2(CC dip) + R2(CH dip).&nbsp; However R2(CC dip) is never more than 5% of the R2(CH dip) rate (in my calculations anyways) and more often than not much less.&nbsp; My reasoning is that R2 already contains a J(0) term so there's no significant gain with homonuclear relaxation as there is in R1, which has no J(0) term to start with, only in the homonuclear case.

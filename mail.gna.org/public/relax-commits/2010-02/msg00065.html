-Finding the dynamics of an entire macromolecule is a complex problem as
-the model-free parameter values are intricately linked to the Brownian
-rotational diffusion of the molecule, mathematically through the
-autocorrelation function of the motion and statistically through model
-selection. The solution to this problem was formulated using set theory as
-an element of the universal set [Formula: see text]-the union of all
-model-free spaces (d'Auvergne EJ and Gooley PR (2007) Mol BioSyst 3(7),
-483-494). The current procedure commonly used to find the universal
-solution is to initially estimate the diffusion tensor parameters, to
-optimise the model-free parameters of numerous models, and then to choose
-the best model via model selection. The global model is then optimised and
-the procedure repeated until convergence. In this paper a new methodology
-is presented which takes a different approach to this diffusion seeded
-model-free paradigm. Rather than starting with the diffusion tensor this
-iterative protocol begins by optimising the model-free parameters in the
-absence of any global model parameters, selecting between all the
-model-free models, and finally optimising the diffusion tensor. The new
-model-free optimisation protocol will be validated using synthetic data
-from Schurr JM et al. (1994) J Magn Reson B 105(3), 211-224 and the
-relaxation data of the bacteriorhodopsin (1-36)BR fragment from Orekhov VY
-(1999) J Biomol NMR 14(4), 345-356. To demonstrate the importance of this
-new procedure the NMR relaxation data of the Olfactory Marker Protein
-(OMP) of Gitti R et al. (2005) Biochem 44(28), 9673-9679 is reanalysed.
-The result is that the dynamics for certain secondary structural elements

 \chapter{Development of relax}
 
-This chapter is written for developers or those who would like to extend the 
functionality of relax.  It is not required for using relax.  If you would 
like to modify relax to suit your needs, please subscribe to all the relax 
mailing lists (see the open source infrastructure chapter for more details).  
Announcements are sent to ``relax-announce at gna.org'' while ``relax-users 
at gna.org'' is the list where discussions about the usage of relax should be 
posted.  ``relax-devel at gna.org'' is where all discussions about the 
development of relax, including feature requests, program design, or any 
other discussions relating to relax's structure or code should be posted.  
Finally, ``relax-commits at gna.org'' is where all changes to relax's code 
and documentation, as well as changes to the web pages, are automatically 
sent to.  Anyone interested in joining the project should subscribe to this 
list as well.

 \subsubsection{Classes}
 
-For classes, relax uses a mix of camel case (for example all the 
\texttt{RelaxError} objects) and underscores (for example 
\texttt{Model\_free}).  The first letter in all cases is always capitalised.  
Generally the camel case is reserved for very low level classes which are 
involved in the program's infrastructure.  Examples include the RelaxError 
code, the threading code, and the \texttt{self.relax.data} code.  All the 
data analysis specific code, generic code, interface code, etc uses 
underscores between the words with only the first letter capitalised.  One 
exception is the space mapping class \texttt{OpenDX}, the reason being that 
the program is called `OpenDX'.

 % Becoming a committer.
 \subsection{Becoming a committer}
 
-After proving oneself, anyone can become a relax developer and obtain commit 
access to the relax repository.  The main criteria for selection by the relax 
developers is to show good judgement, competence in producing good patches, 
compliance with the coding and commit log conventions, comportment on the 
mailing lists, not producing too many bugs, only taking on challenges which 
can be handled, and the skill in judging your own abilities.  After a number 
of patches have been submitted and accepted, any of the relax developers can 
propose that you receive commit access.  If a number of developers agree 
while no one says no, then commit access will be offered.
-
-One area where coding ability can be demonstrated is within the relax test 
suite.  The addition of tests, especially those where the relax internal data 
structures of \texttt{self.relax.data} are scrutinised, can be a good 
starting point for learning the structure of relax.  The beauty of the tests 
are that the introduction of bugs has no effect on normal program execution.  
The relax test suite is an ideal proving ground.

need to have an understanding of the concepts of version control, 
specifically those relating to Subversion.  The SVN book at 
\href{<a  href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/}{http://svnbook.red-bean.com/}">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/}{http://svnbook.red-bean.com/}</a> contains

that you receive commit access.  If a number of developers agree while no one 
says no, then commit access will be offered.

 If skills in only certain areas of relax development, for example in 
creation of the documentation, an understanding of C but not python, an 
understanding of solely the code of the user interface, or an understanding 
of the code specific to a certain type of data analysis methodology, then 
partial commit access may be granted.  Although you will have the ability to 
make modifications to any part of the repository, please make modifications 
only those areas for which you have permission.

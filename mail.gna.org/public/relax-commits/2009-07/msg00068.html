  r8681 | bugman | 2009-01-27 18:35:10 +0100 (Tue, 27 Jan 2009) | 6 lines
  
  Removed the dependence of the relax_errors and relax_warnings modules on 
relax.
  
  This fixes some rare circular import failures with the --debug flag and 
makes the modules much
  cleaner and more independent.
................
  r8683 | bugman | 2009-01-27 18:48:32 +0100 (Tue, 27 Jan 2009) | 6 lines
  
  Improvements to the relax_errors module.
  
  The module function save_state() can now function if this module is used by 
something other than
  relax.  The saved state is also BZip compressed if the bz2 module exists.
................
  r8714 | bugman | 2009-02-02 10:58:41 +0100 (Mon, 02 Feb 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Added some printouts stating which file the relax saved state is placed in 
when in Debug mode.
................
  r8717 | bugman | 2009-02-02 11:30:54 +0100 (Mon, 02 Feb 2009) | 11 lines
  
  Fixed an annoying bug in the RelaxError debugging mode.
  
  The problem here is that the relax state was being saved in the __init__() 
methods if in debug mode.
  The result was that in try statements which catch and allow for 
RelaxErrors, the relax state was
  being saved even though the error message and exception was suppressed.  
The fix was to shift the
  state saving code into the __str__() method.
  
  A side effect of this change is a simplification of all the RelaxError 
classes as the debug code is
  no longer duplicated in each class.
................
  r8723 | bugman | 2009-02-03 18:05:58 +0100 (Tue, 03 Feb 2009) | 6 lines
  
  Wrote 2 new system tests for the new structural data design.
  
  In test_read_pdb_internal6(), 2 different structures are loaded as 2 
molecules.  In
  test_read_pdb_internal7(), 2 identical structures are loaded as 2 molecules.
................
  r8725 | bugman | 2009-02-04 10:33:25 +0100 (Wed, 04 Feb 2009) | 3 lines

  Bug fix for the load_pdb() method.

................
  r8727 | bugman | 2009-02-04 10:51:40 +0100 (Wed, 04 Feb 2009) | 6 lines
  
  Fixes for the test_read_pdb_mol_2_model_scientific() system test.
  
  The Scientific python PDB reader somehow decided to split the single 
structures in
  'lactose_MCMM4_S1_*.pdb' into 2.

  Retarded Scientific python splitting a perfectly good molecule into 2 when 
it can't recognise a
  residue type!
................
  r8735 | bugman | 2009-02-05 10:00:21 +0100 (Thu, 05 Feb 2009) | 6 lines
  
  Modified test_read_pdb_internal1() to catch a molecule name identification 
bug.
  
  The test_read_pdb_scientific1() was similarly modified, but there is no bug 
in the Scientific python
  code.

................
  r8741 | bugman | 2009-02-05 14:41:36 +0100 (Thu, 05 Feb 2009) | 22 lines
  
  Massive speed up of the bond_vectors() method.
  
  The algorithm used was very, very poorly designed.  Now when setting the 
profile flag to 1 gives the
  following.  Before in one test:
  
           11168736 function calls (10986641 primitive calls) in 76.750 CPU 
seconds
  
     ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
     758954   12.160    0.000   51.060    0.000 
/home/edau/relax/relax-1.3/generic_fns/relax_re.py:31(search)
        141    0.890    0.006   67.620    0.480 
/home/edau/relax/relax-1.3/generic_fns/structure/internal.py:444(bond_vectors)
  
  All other function call info lines have been removed.  After the changes:
  
           2586419 function calls (2579305 primitive calls) in 21.370 CPU 
seconds
  
     ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
      62803    1.180    0.000    5.020    0.000 
/home/edau/relax/relax-1.3/generic_fns/relax_re.py:31(search)
        141    0.060    0.000   12.020    0.085 
/home/edau/relax/relax-1.3/generic_fns/structure/internal.py:444(bond_vectors)
  
  The difference is that the selection object is no longer used, as it is 
completely unnecessary.
................
  r8742 | bugman | 2009-02-05 14:42:51 +0100 (Thu, 05 Feb 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Modified the base API bond_vectors() method.
................
  r8743 | bugman | 2009-02-05 14:46:28 +0100 (Thu, 05 Feb 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Added the atoms 'NZ' and 'OH' as nitrogens and oxygens of amino acids 
respectively.
................
  r8744 | bugman | 2009-02-05 14:54:50 +0100 (Thu, 05 Feb 2009) | 8 lines
  
  Fixes for the bond_vectors() method.
  
  The atom_id string is now generated as it is no longer passed in.  This is 
a temporary fix and this
  function is very inefficient, just as the internal object bond_vectors() 
method was (which was fixed
  in r8741).
................
  r8745 | bugman | 2009-02-05 15:00:36 +0100 (Thu, 05 Feb 2009) | 5 lines
  
  Fix for the test_read_pdb_scientific1() system test.

probabilities.

  Fix for the __linear_constraints() method.
  
  The last probability N is not in the scaling matrix!  Therefore don't scale.
................
  r8750 | bugman | 2009-02-06 11:57:46 +0100 (Fri, 06 Feb 2009) | 6 lines

         This code calculates three functions for each residue. When comparing datasets from
         different magnetic field, the value should be the same for each function as these are field
-        field independent. The J(0) function is the spectral density at the zero frequency and is
-        obtained using a reduced spectral density approach. The F_eta and F_R2 functions are the
+        independent. The J(0) function is the spectral density at the zero frequency and is obtained
+        using a reduced spectral density approach. The F_eta and F_R2 functions are the
         consistency functions proposed by Fushman D. et al. (1998) JACS, 120: 10947-10952.
+
+        To assess the consistency of its datasets, one should first calculate those values (J(0),
+        F_eta and F_R2) for each field. Then, the user should compare values obtained for different
+        magnetic fields. Comparisons could proceed using correlation plots and histograms, and the
+        user could also calculate correlation, skewness and kurtosis coefficients.

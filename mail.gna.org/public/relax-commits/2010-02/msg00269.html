  Modified the IO redirection methods.
  
  The original IO streams are stored and then restore instead of 
sys.__stdout__ and sys.__stderr__.
  This might help in the multi-processor branch where IO redirection has gone 
haywire.

  Big bug fix for the model-free grid search!!!
  
  The lower and upper bounds were being scaled iteratively for each spin 
causing the values to be
  ridiculously bigger and bigger.  This caused a total failure of the grid 
search.

  Added 12 unit tests for all notations of R -&gt; Euler -&gt; R.
  
  This uses a random rotation matrix and sees if the matrix is returned.

  Important bug fix for the R_to_euler() function.
  
  The special angle wrapping when beta was negative is only for the ijk Euler 
notation when i == k!
  When i != k, another type of wrapping will be required.

  Spun out the automatic model-free protocol code from the full_analysis.py 
script.
  
  This is discussed in the post 
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://mail.gna.org/public/relax-devel/2010-01/msg00075.html">https://mail.gna.org/public/relax-devel/2010-01/msg00075.html</a>.
  
  The aim is to have a single code base for the automatic protocols for all 
UI designs (prompt,
  script, GUI, web interface, etc.).  The API interface will be via class 
initialisations.  The
  automatic model-free protocol has been placed into the dAuvergne_protocol 
class.
  
  Future aims of this code is to have the UI fill a single data pipe with all 
the data required for
  the analysis, and then to pass in this pipe into the protocol.  Then the 
auto-analysis will copy
  this info into any other data pipes it requires.  This will allow for 
better GUI interaction, data
  display, etc.

  r10297 | bugman | 2010-01-25 11:33:22 +0100 (Mon, 25 Jan 2010) | 3 lines
  
  Removed all the now unused imports and a useless comment.

  r10299 | bugman | 2010-01-25 11:37:25 +0100 (Mon, 25 Jan 2010) | 3 lines

........
  r10300 | bugman | 2010-01-25 12:13:59 +0100 (Mon, 25 Jan 2010) | 3 lines
  
  Modifications to the phthalic_acid_noes.py system test script to allow for 
standalone operation.
........
  r10301 | bugman | 2010-01-25 12:40:54 +0100 (Mon, 25 Jan 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Fixes for the N-state model for when only NOEs are present.
  
  This fixes a bug introduced at r10243.
........
  r10302 | bugman | 2010-01-25 12:54:34 +0100 (Mon, 25 Jan 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Bug fix for the bug fix of r10301!
  
  The bug fix actually introduced a bug, and this commit fixes that!
........
  r10304 | bugman | 2010-01-25 14:25:32 +0100 (Mon, 25 Jan 2010) | 11 lines
  
  Redesign of the setup of the names spaces for the user functions.
  
  All the user functions and other objects located in the run() method 
namespace have been shifted
  into the interpreter self._locals dictionary.  These are then placed into 
the run() method namespace
  by looping over the keys and using the 'locals()[key] = object' syntax.  
There may be better ways to
  do this.
  
  This has no visible effect on the prompt or script based interfaces.  It 
will change how this is
  seen by other modules though, and will allow the namespace to be more 
easily accessed.
........
  r10305 | bugman | 2010-01-25 14:26:57 +0100 (Mon, 25 Jan 2010) | 3 lines
  
  Removed some unused and commented out code.
........
  r10306 | bugman | 2010-01-25 14:31:09 +0100 (Mon, 25 Jan 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Eliminated the dummy mode.
  
  This is only used by the fetch_docstrings script and will soon not be 
necessary.
........
  r10307 | bugman | 2010-01-25 15:55:49 +0100 (Mon, 25 Jan 2010) | 7 lines
  
  The relax base object is no longer passed into the class namespace of the 
user functions.
  
  This was only being used for access to the intro flag (a few other cases 
exist, but these should be
  fixed).  Now a new container object with this flag is being passed in.  
This significantly
  simplifies the code paths and removes the need for the test suite to create 
'fake' relax instances.
........
  r10308 | bugman | 2010-01-25 16:08:41 +0100 (Mon, 25 Jan 2010) | 7 lines
  
  Modified how the Exec_info data container is handled.
  
  The class was shifted from prompt.interpreter to prompt.base_class.  In 
addition if not container
  is passed into the user function classes, then one is created with the 
intro flag set to a default
  of True.
........
  r10309 | bugman | 2010-01-25 16:34:44 +0100 (Mon, 25 Jan 2010) | 8 lines
  
  The prompt info has been shifted into the execution info container.
  
  The sys.ps1, sys.ps2, and sys.ps3 prompts are still set, but these strings 
are hardcoded into the
  execution info container.  This allows the user functions to be imported 
and operate outside of the
  prompt/scripting based interface, as the no longer require sys.ps3 to be 
set or the relax main
  instance passed into them.
........
  r10310 | bugman | 2010-01-25 16:39:34 +0100 (Mon, 25 Jan 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Eliminated the fake_relax instance dependence.
  
  This is no longer necessary as the user functions can be initialised 
without relax.
........
  r10311 | bugman | 2010-01-25 16:53:14 +0100 (Mon, 25 Jan 2010) | 3 lines
  
  Created the populate_self() method to place all user functions into the 
interpreter namespace.
........
  r10312 | bugman | 2010-01-25 16:58:57 +0100 (Mon, 25 Jan 2010) | 5 lines
  
  The relax main instance is no longer passed into the test suite.
  
  This can be done as the prompt/script interface has been detached from 
relax.
........
  r10313 | bugman | 2010-01-25 17:00:12 +0100 (Mon, 25 Jan 2010) | 5 lines

  r10315 | bugman | 2010-01-25 18:04:17 +0100 (Mon, 25 Jan 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Created the SystemTestCase base class for all the system tests to use.
  
  This base class initialises the relax interpreter within the TestCase class 
instances.

  Epydoc is now documenting everything!
  
  The whitelist system of selected what to document was not working!  Too 
many packages are changing,
  especially in the branches.  Therefore absolutely everything is now being 
documented, including the
  test suite.  This will allow all new packages to be automatically 
documented.

following str objects:
      - title:  The program title 'relax'
      - version:  For example 'repository checkout' or '1.3.8'.
      - desc:  The short program description.
      - copyright:  A list of copyright statements.
      - licence:  Text pertaining to the licencing.
      - errors:  A list of import errors.
  
  This is being abstracted so that the different UIs can use this 
differently.  The prompt/script can
  word wrap to 100 char (80 char in Windows), and print this to stdout.  The 
GUI can use this in the
  about prompt and not print to stdout.  Other interfaces can use this in any 
other way.  And the
  information content can be expanded for different purposes.

  Shifted the introductory text object into its own module.
  
  This makes the use of this object more flexible as anything and any part of 
the program can import
  it.

  Shifted the spacing() method from relax to the intro module and renamed it 
to centre().
  
  The docstring has also been expanded to include epydoc tags.

  The introductory text for the prompt/script based interface is now 
recreated.
  
  The _build_intro_text() method has been added to replicate the formatting 
of the deleted
  get_intro_text() method of the main relax class.  This formatting is only 
to be used in these 2 UIs.

  Changed the program description again.
  
  The program is now described as &quot;Molecular dynamics by NMR data analysis&quot;.  
This takes into account
  that this is for proteins, RNA, DNA, organic molecules, sugars, etc., and 
for relaxation data, RDCs,
  PCSs, NOEs, and all NMR data.

  Better UI separation in the Intro_text descriptions.
  
  The 'help' assistance message has been shifted directly into 
prompt.interpreter as it is only part
  of the prompt/script interface.  The GPL message has been changed to 
specify that it is at the
  prompt that you type GPL.

  Renamed the intro.Intro_text class to info.Info_box.
  
  This is used for introduction strings, but can be used at any point in 
relax as well.

  Each reference is a container placed within the 'bib' dictionary of the 
info box class.

  Created the module for the automatic relaxation curve fitting protocol.
  
  This should better help define the API interface between the UIs and the 
core, allowing all UIs to
  benefit from advances in this code base.

  A couple of fixes for the Relax_fit auto analysis class.
  
  The interpreter was not being imported and a class variable was missing the 
'self.' part!

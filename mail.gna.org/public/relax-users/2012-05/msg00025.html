<pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi Jimmy,

I have just fixed a bug that I introduced with the multiple bond
vector recent fixes.  So if you have run 'svn up' between now and my
previous mail, you will need to run this command again to get this
fix.

Regards,

Edward

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi Jimmy,

Thank you for that info, I can now clearly see the problem :)  I have
modified the 1.3 relax line to catch this problem, so if you run 'svn
up' on your checked out copy and rerun the script, the error will be
much more informative.  I have also modified the structure.vectors
user function so that you will be informed as to how many vectors this
reads in.

Because of the problem, it would be appreciated if you could create a
massively truncated PDB and relaxation data files with script, and
attach it to your bug report (assuming this data still reproduces the
error).  The problem, as indicated by the print out you sent, is
possibly a mal-formed PDB file.  The following two relax print out
lines reveal this problem:

Adding molecule 'rS2_mol1' to model None (from the original molecule
number 1 of model None)
Adding molecule 'rS2_mol2' to model None (from the original molecule
number 2 of model None)

Without seeing the PDB file itself, it looks like your the file
contains two NMR models without the PDB 'MODEL' record within the
file.  Is this the case?  Alternatively it could be a perfectly fine
X-ray structure with two identical molecules within the unit cell.  In
any case, if there is a truncated data set attached to the bug, I
could add this to the relax test suite and then build a better
solution around this.  As the PDB format has incredibly abused across
the decades, being able to handle the entire PDB universe elegantly is
a very difficult problem.

Cheers,

Edward

&quot;&quot;&quot;Script for black-box model-free analysis.

This script is designed for those who appreciate black-boxes or those who
appreciate complex code.  Importantly data at multiple magnetic field
strengths is essential for this analysis.  The script will need to be
heavily tailored to the molecule in question by changing the variables just
below this documentation.  If you would like to change how model-free
analysis is performed, the code in the class Main can be changed as needed.
For a description of object-oriented coding in python using classes,
functions/methods, self, etc., see the python tutorial.

If you have obtained this script without the program relax, please visit

How to use this script
======================

The value of the variable DIFF_MODEL will determine the behaviour of this
script.  The five diffusion models used in this script are:

    Model I   (MI)   - Local tm.
    Model II  (MII)  - Sphere.
    Model III (MIII) - Prolate spheroid.
    Model IV  (MIV)  - Oblate spheroid.
    Model V   (MV)   - Ellipsoid.

Model I must be optimised prior to any of the other diffusion models, while
the Models II to V can be optimised in any order.  To select the various
models, set the variable DIFF_MODEL to the following strings:

    MI   - 'local_tm'
    MII  - 'sphere'
    MIII - 'prolate'
    MIV  - 'oblate'
    MV   - 'ellipsoid'

This approach has the advantage of eliminating the need for an initial
estimate of a global diffusion tensor and removing all the problems
associated with the initial estimate.

It is important that the number of parameters in a model does not exceed 
the
number of relaxation data sets for that spin.  If this is the case, the 
list
of models in the MF_MODELS and LOCAL_TM_MODELS variables will need to be
trimmed.


Model I - Local tm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This will optimise the diffusion model whereby all spin of the molecule 
have
a local tm value, i.e. there is no global diffusion tensor.  This model
needs to be optimised prior to optimising any of the other diffusion
models.  Each spin is fitted to the multiple model-free models separately,
where the parameter tm is included in each model.

AIC model selection is used to select the models for each spin.


Model II - Sphere
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This will optimise the isotropic diffusion model.  Multiple steps are
required, an initial optimisation of the diffusion tensor, followed by a
repetitive optimisation until convergence of the diffusion tensor.  Each of
these steps requires this script to be rerun. For the initial optimisation,
which will be placed in the directory './sphere/init/', the following steps
are used:

The model-free models and parameter values for each spin are set to those 
of
diffusion model MI.

The local tm parameter is removed from the models.

The model-free parameters are fixed and a global spherical diffusion tensor
is minimised.


For the repetitive optimisation, each minimisation is named from 'round_1'
onwards.  The initial 'round_1' optimisation will extract the diffusion
tensor from the results file in './sphere/init/', and the results will be
placed in the directory './sphere/round_1/'.  Each successive round will
take the diffusion tensor from the previous round.  The following steps are
used:

The global diffusion tensor is fixed and the multiple model-free models are
fitted to each spin.

AIC model selection is used to select the models for each spin.

All model-free and diffusion parameters are allowed to vary and a global
optimisation of all parameters is carried out.


Model III - Prolate spheroid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The methods used are identical to those of diffusion model MII, except that
an axially symmetric diffusion tensor with Da &gt;= 0 is used.  The base
directory containing all the results is './prolate/'.


Model IV - Oblate spheroid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The methods used are identical to those of diffusion model MII, except that
an axially symmetric diffusion tensor with Da &lt;= 0 is used.  The base
directory containing all the results is './oblate/'.


Model V - Ellipsoid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The methods used are identical to those of diffusion model MII, except that
a fully anisotropic diffusion tensor is used (also known as rhombic or
asymmetric diffusion).  The base directory is './ellipsoid/'.



Final run
~~~~~~~~~

Once all the diffusion models have converged, the final run can be
executed.  This is done by setting the variable DIFF_MODEL to 'final'.  
This
consists of two steps, diffusion tensor model selection, and Monte Carlo
simulations.  Firstly AIC model selection is used to select between the
diffusion tensor models.  Monte Carlo simulations are then run solely on
this selected diffusion model.  Minimisation of the model is bypassed as it
is assumed that the model is already fully optimised (if this is not the
case the final run is not yet appropriate).

The final black-box model-free results will be placed in the file
'final/results'.

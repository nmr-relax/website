<pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi Edward,

ok I uploaded a tar file with synthetic peaks for one spin system:

file #22989

The saturation recovery formula is:

 I0*(1 - exp(−R1*t))

The parameters I used were

I0 = 1000000000000000.00

and

R1 = 0.5

Obviously, the same numbers also work for the inversion recovery experiment:

I(t) = I∞ − I0*exp(−R1*t)

with I∞ set to 1000000000000000.00 as well. Not sure how much that helps 
though.


If &quot;inv&quot; is not implemented, then that would explain the weird results :)

Unfortunately, I have no primary reference for the saturation recovery 
experiment either.

Best regards,
Andras

Hi Andras,


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Thank you for your help.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

No problems.  Hopefully we can get this running without too much effort.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Are Monte Carlo simulations used for the error analysis in CCPNMR
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">(<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ccpn.ac.uk/software/analysis">http://www.ccpn.ac.uk/software/analysis</a>)?  What do you mean that it
is not robust enough?  From the equation you sent, it does not look
like your experiment is either inversion recovery or saturation
recovery.

I don't know how CCPNMR does it's fitting (it's a bit of black box), but I 
don't believe that it does Monte Carlo simulations. What I mean by not 
robust enough is, that the fit fails instead of producing a result. The 
fitting routine in ccpnmr takes seconds or less, and therefore I guess that 
it is not very sophisticated.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

I thought it did carry out real Monte Carlo simulations, unlike a lot
of the other software out there (excluding curvefit and relax), but I
no longer remember.  I think I asked this once on the relax mailing
lists and received a response, but I cannot find the old posts.
Anyway, the fitting is also very quick in relax as this is an
incredibly simple problem.  The optimisation part for a single spin
can be measured in milliseconds.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Do you have a good original reference for your experiment?  I.e. one
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">with the pulse sequence and also the exponential equation used?  You
said that the formula for your data is:
I(t) =  I0*(1 - exp(−R1*t))        (1)
In the relax implementation, the formula is:
I(t) = I0*exp(-Rx*t)        (2)
These are clearly not the same as (2) heads to zero as t-&gt;inf, whereas
(1) heads to I0 as t-&gt;inf.

I am not comparing the saturation recovery experiment to a standard 
relaxation decay, but to an inversion recovery experiment. The inversion 
recovery experiment is implemented in relax &quot;according to the manual&quot; as
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

I'm not sure what a standard R1 decay is.  I would have guessed a 180
degree pulse on the spin in the ground state and then watch the peak
intensity return to the ground state - i.e. standard inversion
recovery.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">I(t) = I∞ − I0*exp(−R1*t), which is a lot more similar to the formula for 
saturation recovery.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

This is currently not implemented in relax.  This is where the
inversion-recovery branch stalled.  So selecting the model 'inv' has
no effect.  This will require someone with motivation to help complete
this ;)  The hardest part is the synthetic data and creation of the
associated system test.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">The reference that I am using for saturation recovery is:
Respondek et al., 2007, Mapping the Orientation of Helices in Micelle-Bound 
Peptides by Paramagnetic Relaxation Waves. JACS.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

For permanent reference, the DOI link is
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja069004f">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja069004f</a> .  Equation (1) in that reference
is:

I(t) =  I0*(1 - exp(−R1*t))        (1)

So this implies that you start at time 0 with zero intensity and then
watch the magnitization return to I0.  Is this correct?  Is this what
'saturation recovery' means?  From Figure 3, and your grace plots
attached to <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/task/?7415">https://gna.org/task/?7415</a>, I would guess so.  It's a pity
this paper doesn't have the reference for this experiment type.  Would
you happen to know the primary reference for 'saturation recovery' or
'signal pre-saturation recovery'?

Anyway, with test data this formula should be very easy to add support for.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">If you look at the plots in the grace folder of the project that I 
uploaded, you can see that everything looks exactly as it should, except 
that the Rx values are negative.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

This is very strange as the only formula currently implemented in relax is:

I(t) = I0*exp(-Rx*t)        (2)

In the saved state file, I can see that the chi-squared values are
huge though.  This implies that the fit is terrible!  So I would not
trust these numbers.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">I will need to look into the generation of synthetic peak lists some more, 
as I have no experience with that. But once we have those, I can load 
synthetic peaks (in e.g. sparky format) into ccpnmr and fit them there to 
double check results.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

It can be done with a calculator, spreadsheet, or script.  Just
calculate new numbers and replace the old using a text editor.  For
example take your 800mhz-303k-*.list files, delete all lines except
for the header and first data line (G17), and then replace its numbers
with your hand calculated ones.  That's it.  You could also run it
through a relax script to see what happens.  If you upload the new
files to <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/task/?7415">https://gna.org/task/?7415</a>, this relax script, and say what
the I0 and Rx numbers are in the comment section, all in one post,
then I could create a system test with this in ~5 min.

Cheers,

Edward


P. S.  Looking at the grace/intensities_norm.agr file attached to
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/task/?7415">https://gna.org/task/?7415</a>, I think we will need to rethink how
normalisation occurs for this experiment type!  Dividing all points by
I0 might be better.  Then all curves terminate at the same intensity
of 1, and you can better differentiate the rates, as setting the first
point to 1 in these graphs to normalise is a bit silly.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Best wishes,
Andras

Hi Andras,

Please see below:

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">I would be very glad to help out with that.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Great!


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">My input data format is sparky peak lists (I export them from ccpnmr, but 
that doesn't make a difference))
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

relax should handle this no problem.  There are system tests set up to
check this compatibility:

<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/support/?3044">https://gna.org/support/?3044</a>
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nmr-relax.com/api/3.3/test_suite.system_tests.peak_lists.Peak_lists-class.html#test_ccpn_analysis">http://www.nmr-relax.com/api/3.3/test_suite.system_tests.peak_lists.Peak_lists-class.html#test_ccpn_analysis</a>

the pdb yet.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

This should be no problem in relax.  Any column formatted file will be
sufficient.  You can even use the spectrum.read_spins user function to
load the sequence out of a peak list.  Anyway, it is better to discuss
such topics on the relax-users mailing list.  I would recommend
signing up for the relax-users and relax-devel mailing list using the

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">I have two spin systems in there, but for testing, we can throw out the 
NHe from my tryptophan indole rings.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

For testing it is best to use synthetic data, see below.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">For my test set, I can even calculate rates for inversion recovery and 
saturation recovery in ccpnmr. The reason that I changed to relax is, that 
the ccpnmr fitting routine is not robust enough for other sets.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Are Monte Carlo simulations used for the error analysis in CCPNMR
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ccpn.ac.uk/software/analysis">http://www.ccpn.ac.uk/software/analysis</a>)?  What do you mean that it
is not robust enough?  From the equation you sent, it does not look
like your experiment is either inversion recovery or saturation
recovery.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">I'm very happy to send you real peak lists, or do they have to be 
synthetic for some reason? I could make real peak lists without tryptophan 
NHes if that helps. For synthetic peak lists, I have no experience in 
making those. But I think I could figure that out.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

For testing an implementation, real data is to be avoided.  The reason
is because you do not know beforehand what the real answer is.  In
software development, this can often lead to an incorrect
implementation.

A synthetic set is easy.  Take a set of Sparky formatted peak lists
for a single spin.  Then pick Rx and I0 values that are reasonable.
For R1, a value of 2.0 might be a good choice.  You could have a
second spin with a different R1 value if you wish.  For the I0, pick a
huge value in the order of 1e15.  The reason is because the peak
heights in a Sparky peak list are stored as integer values and not
floating point values.  By starting with a large intensity, you
thereby minimise truncation artefacts.  For the R1 and I0 value,
together with the time points used in the experiment, the formula of
interest can be used to then calculate the intensity for each time
point.  These can then replace the values in the Sparky peak lists to
create the synthetic test set.  Do not truncate the numbers by using
the format 9.62E+07, instead include the full integer number into the
text file.

Using this, a system test can then be set up in relax.  It would
consist of a script similar to your wr1043_0N_relax_fit.py script.
Optimisation would be performed, and then the values of R1 and I0
checked to see if the exact values can be found (to a very high degree
of accuracy).  For example as in the
Relax_fit.test_zooming_grid_search system test which can be run as:

$ relax -sd Relax_fit.test_zooming_grid_search system

This assumes you are not using the Mac OS X dmg distribution file.
The test itself is:

<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nmr-relax.com/api/3.3/test_suite.system_tests.relax_fit.Relax_fit-class.html#test_zooming_grid_search">http://www.nmr-relax.com/api/3.3/test_suite.system_tests.relax_fit.Relax_fit-class.html#test_zooming_grid_search</a>

This uses the script located at
test_suite/system_tests/scripts/relax_fit_zooming_grid.py.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">I am attaching one set of relax that I did on this system with inversion 
recovery to the task and if this is what you are looking for, then I can 
also send you R1 values for inversion and saturation recovery fitting of 
this set in ccpnmr.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

For reference, the file is attached to task #7415
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/task/?7415">https://gna.org/task/?7415</a>) as the file Relax.tar.gz
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/task/download.php?file_id=22980">https://gna.org/task/download.php?file_id=22980</a>).  The synthetic data
would be far better.  Could such synthetic data be put through CCPNMR?
 Once the synthetic cases are implemented and returning the expected
result, then it could be applied to real data and comparisons between
software made.  However comparing the results of the synthetic data
for different software is a far better method, as it is a real
positive control.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">I did have a problem with the experiment that I ran on relax though. It 
does converge and produces beautiful values, but the Rx values are 
negative. Which doesn't make any sense to me. The pattern is exactly as it 
should be, but the values are simply wrong. Do you have an idea what could 
be going on there?
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Do you have a good original reference for your experiment?  I.e. one
with the pulse sequence and also the exponential equation used?  You
said that the formula for your data is:

I(t) =  I0*(1 - exp(−R1*t))        (1)

In the relax implementation, the formula is:

I(t) = I0*exp(-Rx*t)        (2)

These are clearly not the same as (2) heads to zero as t-&gt;inf, whereas
(1) heads to I0 as t-&gt;inf.  To determine exactly what is happening,
the synthetic data would be best.  Are you sure you reported the
correct equation?  Equation (1) is zero when t is zero, which does not
seem to make sense.  Should the saturation recover not start at I0 and
return to zero?  Equation (2) is supposed to be the one used for
saturation recovery.  Maybe your data is actually in the form of:

I(t) = -I0*exp(-Rx*t)        (3)

Cheers,

Edward


P. S.  Note that there is a 6 hour time zone difference, so I may only
be able to answer you in your mornings.

Hi Andras,

I was wondering if you were interested in helping out with the
inversion-recovery task at <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/task/index.php?7415">https://gna.org/task/index.php?7415</a> ?  What
is your input data format, i.e. which peak list format are you using?
Would it be possible to create synthetic peak lists containing with a
single spin system whereby you have calculated what the peak
intensities are based on your equation and some I0 and Rx parameter
values?  If this could be done, it could be added to the relax test
suite directories and form the basis of an implementation.  It could
easily then be used to create a system test which checks that the
fitting occurs as expected.  Then implementing this should be easy.

Cheers,

Edward

Hi,

would it be possible to add an option to fit saturation recovery 
experiments
to the existing 'exp' and 'inv' options in relax_fit?

The formula should look like this:

I(t) =  I0*(1 - exp(−R1*t))

Best regards,
Andras Boeszoermenyi

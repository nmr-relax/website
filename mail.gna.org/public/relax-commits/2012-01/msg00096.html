................
  r14819 | bugman | 2011-10-11 10:28:29 +0200 (Tue, 11 Oct 2011) | 6 lines
  
  Added a truncated version of the CaM-KKalpha data from the BMRB 15183 entry 
for system tests.
  
  This will be used to validate the Grace plotting when multiple types of 
spin are present.
................
  r14820 | bugman | 2011-10-11 10:53:51 +0200 (Tue, 11 Oct 2011) | 3 lines

  The alignment_tensor.fix user function is now tensor specific.
  
  This will allow a subset of tensors to be optimised while the others are 
kept fixed.  The specific
  analysis code will need to be updated for this.

  These are to allow the test to complete in a reasonable time.

................
  r14869 | bugman | 2011-10-14 10:21:50 +0200 (Fri, 14 Oct 2011) | 6 lines
  
  Fix for a problem introduced at r14810 - relax uses D and not 2D internally 
for the RDCs.
  
  This is only a problem if the rdc.read 'data_type' argument is used.  This 
is only a few days old so
  will affect no one!
................
  r14870 | bugman | 2011-10-14 16:31:45 +0200 (Fri, 14 Oct 2011) | 6 lines
  
  Bug fix allowing relax to be run in profiling mode.

coding and debugging
  functionality.
................
  r14871 | bugman | 2011-10-14 16:37:52 +0200 (Fri, 14 Oct 2011) | 6 lines
  
  Bug fix for the profiling!
  
  This coding and debugging functionality now works again.  This has been 
broken since the merger of
  the multi-processor branch.
................
  r14872 | bugman | 2011-10-14 20:29:51 +0200 (Fri, 14 Oct 2011) | 5 lines
  
  Increased the efficiency of the relax data store spin system creation.
  
  This becomes noticeable when large numbers of structures are read into 
relax.
................
  r14873 | bugman | 2011-10-17 13:59:57 +0200 (Mon, 17 Oct 2011) | 6 lines
  
  Added the bc flag to the RDC and PCS display and write user function 
front-ends.
  
  This This will allow the back-calculated data to be displayed or written 
rather than the measured
  values.
................
  r14874 | bugman | 2011-10-17 14:09:51 +0200 (Mon, 17 Oct 2011) | 5 lines
  
  Updated the RDC and PCS display and write user function backends for the 
new bc flag.
  
  This allows access to the back-calculated rather than measured data.
................
  r14875 | bugman | 2011-10-17 18:31:38 +0200 (Mon, 17 Oct 2011) | 3 lines

ID strings at the start.
................
  r14876 | bugman | 2011-10-18 08:51:59 +0200 (Tue, 18 Oct 2011) | 5 lines
  
  Bug fix for the relax_io.read_spin_data() function for spin IDs.
  
  Spin IDs can now be handled if they are the first column in the data file!
................
  r14877 | bugman | 2011-10-18 09:13:22 +0200 (Tue, 18 Oct 2011) | 7 lines
  
  The rdc and pcs display and write user functions now output mol, res, and 
spin name and num cols.
  
  Instead of the spin ID column, these user functions now output the molecule 
name, residue name,
  residue number, spin name and spin number columns.  This is better to read 
back into relax as info
  such as the spin number can be ignored to allow different PDB files to be 
used.
................
  r14878 | bugman | 2011-10-18 10:39:11 +0200 (Tue, 18 Oct 2011) | 5 lines

tensors.
  
  This excludes fixed tensors by default.

  r14879 | bugman | 2011-10-18 10:47:58 +0200 (Tue, 18 Oct 2011) | 5 lines
  
  Created the alignment tensor module return_tensor() function for returning 
tensors.
  
  This takes fixed tensors into account, skipping them if the skip_fixed flag 
is set.

tensors.
................
  r14881 | bugman | 2011-10-18 15:46:27 +0200 (Tue, 18 Oct 2011) | 6 lines
  
  Fix for the set up of Monte Carlo data for fixed alignment tensors in the 
N-state model.
  
  The _minimise_setup_fixed_tensors() method has been fixed to return the 
actual tensor rather than
  simulation for the fixed tensors, as there is no simulation tensor in that 
case.
................
  r14882 | bugman | 2011-10-21 11:12:39 +0200 (Fri, 21 Oct 2011) | 5 lines

  r14883 | bugman | 2011-10-23 18:51:42 +0200 (Sun, 23 Oct 2011) | 11 lines
  
  Added a few new RelaxError classes.
  
  These include:
      RelaxNoneListFloatError
      RelaxMatrixFloatError
      RelaxNoneMatrixFloatError
  
  The BaseArgError class was also modified to handle the length arg (now the 
size arg) being a tuple
  for matrix sizes.

  Created the front end for the new structure.rotate user function.
  
  The purpose of this user function is to apply arbitrary rotations to the 
structures loaded into
  relax about a given origin.

  Started to create some data for testing the frame order theory.
  
  This will be used to generate synthetic data for all 9 models currently in 
relax.

  The resultant average position PDB file and relax save file have also been 
added for reference.

  Modified the rigid frame order CaM test model script to properly test the 
PyMOL representation.
  
  This is not a system test, but is to be used manually and visually to check 
that the PyMOL
  representation created by relax of the average position, eigenframe, and 
cone is correct!

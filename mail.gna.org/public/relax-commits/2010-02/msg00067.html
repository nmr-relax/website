+    abstract       = &quot;Model-free analysis of NMR relaxation data, which is 
widely used for the study of protein dynamics, consists of the separation of 
the global rotational diffusion from internal motions relative to the 
diffusion frame and the description of these internal motions by amplitude 
and timescale. Five model-free models exist, each of which describes a 
different type of motion. Model-free analysis requires the selection of the 
model which best describes the dynamics of the NH bond. It will be 
demonstrated that the model selection technique currently used has two 
significant flaws, under-fitting, and not selecting a model when one ought to 
be selected. Under-fitting breaks the principle of parsimony causing bias in 
the final model-free results, visible as an overestimation of S2 and an 
underestimation of taue and Rex. As a consequence the protein falsely appears 
to be more rigid than it actually is. Model selection has been extensively 
developed in other fields. The techniques known as Akaike's Information 
Criteria (AIC), small sample size corrected AIC (AICc), Bayesian Information 
Criteria (BIC), bootstrap methods, and cross-validation will be compared to 
the currently used technique. To analyse the variety of techniques, synthetic 
noisy data covering all model-free motions was created. The data consists of 
two types of three-dimensional grid, the Rex grids covering single motions 
with chemical exchange [S2,taue,Rex], and the Double Motion grids covering 
two internal motions [S f 2,S s 2,tau s ]. The conclusion of the comparison 
is that for accurate model-free results, AIC model selection is essential. As 
the method neither under, nor over-fits, AIC is the best tool for applying 
Occam's razor and has the additional benefits of simplifying and speeding up 
model-free analysis.&quot;

+    abstract       = &quot;Model-free analysis is a technique commonly used 
within the field of NMR spectroscopy to extract atomic resolution, 
interpretable dynamic information on multiple timescales from the R (1), R 
(2), and steady state NOE. Model-free approaches employ two disparate areas 
of data analysis, the discipline of mathematical optimisation, specifically 
the minimisation of a chi(2) function, and the statistical field of model 
selection. By searching through a large number of model-free minimisations, 
which were setup using synthetic relaxation data whereby the true underlying 
dynamics is known, certain model-free models have been identified to, at 
times, fail. This has been characterised as either the internal correlation 
times, tau( e ), tau( f ), or tau( s ), or the global correlation time 
parameter, local tau( m ), heading towards infinity, the result being that 
the final parameter values are far from the true values. In a number of cases 
the minimised chi(2) value of the failed model is significantly lower than 
that of all other models and, hence, will be the model which is chosen by 
model selection techniques. If these models are not removed prior to model 
selection the final model-free results could be far from the truth. By 
implementing a series of empirical rules involving inequalities these models 
can be specifically isolated and removed. Model-free analysis should 
therefore consist of three distinct steps: model-free minimisation, 
model-free model elimination, and finally model-free model selection. Failure 
has also been identified to affect the individual Monte Carlo simulations 
used within error analysis. Each simulation involves an independent 
randomised relaxation data set and model-free minimisation, thus simulations 
suffer from exactly the same types of failure as model-free models. 
Therefore, to prevent these outliers from causing a significant 
overestimation of the errors the failed Monte Carlo simulations need to be 
culled prior to calculating the parameter standard deviations.&quot;

+    abstract       = &quot;Model-free analysis of NMR relaxation data, which 
describes the motion of individual atoms, is a problem intricately linked to 
the Brownian rotational diffusion of the macromolecule. The diffusion tensor 
parameters strongly influence the optimisation of the various model-free 
models and the subsequent model selection between them. Finding the optimal 
model of the dynamics of the system among the numerous diffusion and 
model-free models is hence quite complex. Using set theory, the entirety of 
this global problem has been encapsulated by the universal set Ll, and its 
resolution mathematically formulated as the universal solution Ll. Ever since 
the original Lipari and Szabo papers the model-free dynamics of a molecule 
has most often been solved by initially estimating the diffusion tensor. The 
model-free models which depend on the diffusion parameter values are then 
optimised and the best model is chosen to represent the dynamics of the 
residue. Finally, the global model of all diffusion and model-free parameters 
is optimised. These steps are repeated until convergence. For simplicity this 
approach to Ll will be labelled the diffusion seeded model-free paradigm. 
Although this technique suffers from a number of problems many have been 
solved. All aspects of the diffusion seeded paradigm and its consequences, 
together with a few alternatives to the paradigm, will be reviewed through 
the use of set notation.&quot;

+    abstract       = &quot;The key to obtaining the model-free description of the 
dynamics of a macromolecule is the optimisation of the model-free and 
Brownian rotational diffusion parameters using the collected R (1), R (2) and 
steady-state NOE relaxation data. The problem of optimising the chi-squared 
value is often assumed to be trivial, however, the long chain of dependencies 
required for its calculation complicates the model-free chi-squared space. 
Convolutions are induced by the Lorentzian form of the spectral density 
functions, the linear recombinations of certain spectral density values to 
obtain the relaxation rates, the calculation of the NOE using the ratio of 
two of these rates, and finally the quadratic form of the chi-squared 
equation itself. Two major topological features of the model-free space 
complicate optimisation. The first is a long, shallow valley which commences 
at infinite correlation times and gradually approaches the minimum. The most 
severe convolution occurs for motions on two timescales in which the minimum 
is often located at the end of a long, deep, curved tunnel or 
multidimensional valley through the space. A large number of optimisation 
algorithms will be investigated and their performance compared to determine 
which techniques are suitable for use in model-free analysis. Local 
optimisation algorithms will be shown to be sufficient for minimisation not 
only within the model-free space but also for the minimisation of the 
Brownian rotational diffusion tensor. In addition the performance of the 
programs Modelfree and Dasha are investigated. A number of model-free 
optimisation failures were identified: the inability to slide along the 
limits, the singular matrix failure of the Levenberg-Marquardt minimisation 
algorithm, the low precision of both programs, and a bug in Modelfree. 
Significantly, the singular matrix failure of the Levenberg-Marquardt 
algorithm occurs when internal correlation times are undefined and is greatly 
amplified in model-free analysis by both the grid search and constraint 
algorithms. The program relax ( <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nmr-relax.com">http://www.nmr-relax.com</a> ) is also presented 
as a new software package designed for the analysis of macromolecular 
dynamics through the use of NMR relaxation data and which alleviates all of 
the problems inherent within model-free analysis.&quot;

+    abstract       = &quot;Finding the dynamics of an entire macromolecule is a 
complex problem as the model-free parameter values are intricately linked to 
the Brownian rotational diffusion of the molecule, mathematically through the 
autocorrelation function of the motion and statistically through model 
selection. The solution to this problem was formulated using set theory as an 
element of the universal set [formula: see text]-the union of all model-free 
spaces (d'Auvergne EJ and Gooley PR (2007) Mol BioSyst 3(7), 483-494). The 
current procedure commonly used to find the universal solution is to 
initially estimate the diffusion tensor parameters, to optimise the 
model-free parameters of numerous models, and then to choose the best model 
via model selection. The global model is then optimised and the procedure 
repeated until convergence. In this paper a new methodology is presented 
which takes a different approach to this diffusion seeded model-free 
paradigm. Rather than starting with the diffusion tensor this iterative 
protocol begins by optimising the model-free parameters in the absence of any 
global model parameters, selecting between all the model-free models, and 
finally optimising the diffusion tensor. The new model-free optimisation 
protocol will be validated using synthetic data from Schurr JM et al. (1994) 
J Magn Reson B 105(3), 211-224 and the relaxation data of the 
bacteriorhodopsin (1-36)BR fragment from Orekhov VY (1999) J Biomol NMR 
14(4), 345-356. To demonstrate the importance of this new procedure the NMR 
relaxation data of the Olfactory Marker Protein (OMP) of Gitti R et al. 
(2005) Biochem 44(28), 9673-9679 is reanalysed. The result is that the 
dynamics for certain secondary structural elements is very different from 
those originally reported.&quot;

interpretation of this information. The procedure used to obtain S /sup 2/ 
and tau /sub e/ from experimental data by using a least-squares method and, 
in certain favorable circumstances, by using an analytical formula is 
described. A variety of experiments are then analyzed to yield information on 
the time scale and spatial restriction of internal motions of isoleucines in 
myoglobin, methionines in dihydrofolate reductase and myoglobin, a number of 
aliphatic residues in basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and ethyl

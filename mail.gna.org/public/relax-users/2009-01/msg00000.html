<pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi,

Warning:  If hard core NMR or physics theory is not to your taste,
please do not read any further!

This post is mainly for later reference, but is quite important for
understanding the relaxation equations in NMR, and actually any
rotational physical process.  It is important for the model-free
equations, for reduced spectral density mapping, for SRLS, and for
relaxation dispersion.  The reason is because R1 and R2 are measured
in rad/s.  As I describe in section 1, the radian unit can be dropped
because it is plainly obvious that NMR and relaxation is an angular
process and hence radian units are implied (that was sarcastic).
Hence R2 can be said to be in units of 1/s, but never, ever Hz.  Also
note that because of the SI conventions described below, describing
the correlation time in s units does not prove that there are no
radian units.  But reporting rates as Hz implies no radian units
whereas reporting as 1/s instead often means radian units are present.

This is also a follow on from the comprehensive unit analysis of
Abragam's relaxation equations at

1  SI supplementary units.

1.1  SI supplementary units (radian and steradian).

Quote from the PDF linked below (page 26) in the table titled &quot;Table
3. Coherent derived units in the SI with special names and symbols&quot;
about the 'SI coherent derived unit' for the 'plane angle' unit of
radian:
&quot;(b) The radian and steradian are special names for the number one
that may be used to convey information about the quantity concerned.
In practice the symbols rad and sr are used where appropriate, but the
symbol for the derived unit one is generally omitted in specifying the
values of dimensionless quantities.&quot;

Quote from the PDF linked below (page 28) in the section titled &quot;2.2.3
Units for dimensionless quantities, also called quantities of
dimension one&quot;:
&quot;In a few cases, however, a special name is given to the unit one, in
order to facilitate the identification of the quantity involved. This
is the case for the radian and the steradian. The radian and steradian
have been identified by the CGPM as special names for the coherent
derived unit one, to be used to express values of plane angle and
solid angle, respectively, and are therefore included in Table 3.&quot;

Quote from the PDF linked below (page 42) in the section titled &quot;5.3.7
Stating values of dimensionless quantities, or quantities of dimension
one&quot;.  This is not very clear but explains why the rad unit is many
times hidden, and why the other dimensionless units such as % and ppm
must be stated (need to read the whole section for that):
&quot;As discussed in Section 2.2.3, the coherent SI unit for dimensionless
quantities, also termed quantities of dimension one, is the number
one, symbol 1. Values of such quantities are expressed simply as
numbers. The unit symbol 1 or unit name &quot;one&quot; are not explicitly
shown, nor are special symbols or names given to the unit one, apart
from a few exceptions as follows. For the quantity plane angle, the
unit one is given the special name radian, symbol rad, and for the
quantity solid angle, the unit one is given the special name
steradian, symbol sr. For the logarithmic ratio quantities, the
special names neper, symbol Np, bel, symbol B, and decibel, symbol dB,
are used (see 4.1 and Table 8, p. 127).&quot;

Quotes from the PDF linked below (page 67) from the appendix section
titled &quot;SI supplementary units (radian and steradian)&quot;:
&quot;...the units radian and steradian are usually introduced into
expressions for units when there is need for clarification...&quot;

Quote from the PDF linked below (page 67) from the appendix section
titled &quot;Elimination of the class of supplementary units in the SI&quot; for
resolution 8 of the CGPM conference:
&quot;decides...&quot;
&quot;to interpret the supplementary units in the SI, namely the radian and
the steradian, as dimensionless derived units, the names and symbols
of which may, but need not, be used in expressions for other SI
derived units, as is convenient,&quot;
&quot;and, consequently, to eliminate the class of supplementary units as a
separate class in the SI.&quot;

1.2  IUPAC report.

This reference explains a bit more clearly why the radian unit is
invisible in most situations.

Title:  Quantities, units, and symbols in physical chemistry (second edition).

Quote from page 11:
&quot;The units radian (rad) and steradian (sr), for plane angle and solid
angle respectively, are described as 'SI supplementary units' [3].
Since they are of dimension 1 (i.e. dimensionless), they may be
included if appropriate, or they may be omitted if clarity is not lost
thereby, in expressions for derived SI units.&quot;

This is the part meaning that radians are implied if you are doing
anything angular.  I don't know what they mean by clarity because by
omitting them it complicates things.  Maybe you have to be a physicist
before you can see this clarity.



2  Spherical harmonics.

The time dependent spherical harmonic can be written as

Y_ml(theta(t), phi(t)),

where theta(t) and phi(t) are the time dependent spherical angles in
the dimensionless radian units.  The time t is normal time and hence
has no hidden radian units.  Spherical harmonics are the angular
portion of the solution to Laplace's equation, and I would assume that
because it is angular, it is using the radian angular SI unit.



3  Rotational correlation times.

My opinion here is that the rotational correlation time is a
descriptor of the change of angles - and these angles are in the
hidden, dimensionless radian units.  Hence the correlation time is
measured in s/rad or in the hidden supplementary unit notation simply
s.  But I prefer to think of the concept as the diffusion rate, a
measure of the rate of rotational Brownian diffusion.

rotate 1 radian (rotational correlation time) or diffuse a distance
equivalent to its own dimensions (translational correlation time).&quot;

Quote (page 243):  &quot;For such sites, the rotational and translational
diffusion of water should both be rate-limited by H-bond
rearrangements and it can therefore be argued that the residence time
(the time taken to diffusion ca. 3 Angstrom) should be close to the
first-rank rotational correlation time (the time taken to rotate
through one radian), i.e., tau_W ~= 3 tau_s (where tau_s is the
second-rank rotational correlation time).&quot;
(Interesting that the factor of 3 is only approximate here!!!  Nils,
do you have a citation where the equation is not appriximate?)

4  Relaxation rates

Here, my opinion is that the R1 and R2 units are rad/s.  The equations
from the book quotations hopefully show this conversion from Hz to
rad/s.

Quote (page 15):  &quot;Because the natural unit for the angular frequency
is radians per second, the relaxation rate, or the inverse of
relaxation time, R2 = 1/T2, should indeed also be expressed in these
units.  Usually, relaxation times are given in seconds (the rates are
given in 1/s), which tacitly implies that the radians can be omitted;
we note in parenthesis that the radian is considered a dimensionless
unit in physics.&quot;

<pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi Edward,

Sorry for the confusion. The local_tm models were generated and handed over 
to the next step of the analysis. However, the local_tm.txt was empty because 
all local_tm values were estimated higher than global tm. S2 values were 
estimated at first in the same size order I also see if I use the HYDRONMR 
diffusion model as a starting point (rather close to one except of two 
flexible loops). However, during the diffusion model selection s2 values 
become smaller and both local and global correlation times bigger. I think 
this could be due to over parameterization, or? I already increased the 
experimental error by factor 2 but this seemed not to help.

I did not remove the protein tag after purification (TEV site + StrepTag, 
about 20 residues).  Because it is also not part of the used Xray crystal 
structure, it might induce a bias also I expect it to be highly flexible and 
move independently from the folded domain.

Regards,

Jonas

Subject: Re: Confidence in Model-free output

Hi,

This sounds like a very strange bug!  Which version of relax are you using?  
Looking at the most up to date code:

    
<a  rel="nofollow" href="/api/4.0/auto_analyses.dauvergne_protocol-pysrc.html#dAuvergne_protocol.execute">http://www.nmr-relax.com/api/4.0/auto_analyses.dauvergne_protocol-pysrc.html#dAuvergne_protocol.execute</a>
(line 718)

I can see that the list of diffusion models comes from the list of 
subdirectories in the results directory:

            # The contents of the results directory.
            dir_list = listdir(self.results_dir)

The list of data pipes used in model selection, self.pipes, is created by 
checking the names in dir_list.  Therefore I can only guess that this is a 
file system error (or the directory was accidentally renamed or moved).  The 
analysis will create the local_tm directory - this is an essential first step 
in this protocol - so it simply cannot find that directory.  Did you notice 
such a problem?  Or did you temporarily run out of hard disk space?  Do you 
have a listing of the results directory and can you see the local_tm/ 
directory there?  This is really, really bizarre!

As for outputting the diffusion tensor information to a text file, you could 
maybe run relax with the --tee flag to output all messages to a file, and 
then load each results file and run diffusion_tensor.display().  
Alternatively you can access the object directly with a relax script, and 
then print out the elements:

relax&gt; pipe.create('test', 'mf')
relax&gt; diffusion_tensor.init((1.340e7, 1.516e7, 1.691e7, 0.000e7,
0.000e7, 0.000e7), param_types=3)
relax&gt; cdp.diff_tensor.Da
2630000.0
relax&gt; print(&quot;Da: %s&quot; % cdp.diff_tensor.Da)
Da: 2630000.0
relax&gt;

Note that the objects in cdp.diff_tensor are automatically generated on 
initialisation and Python will raise an AttributeError if you ask for a 
parameter that does not exist for that diffusion tensor type (see the full 
parameter list at 
<a  rel="nofollow" href="/api/4.0/data_store.diff_tensor-pysrc.html#DiffTensorData">http://www.nmr-relax.com/api/4.0/data_store.diff_tensor-pysrc.html#DiffTensorData</a>
).

Regards,

Edward

Thanks for coming back to me. The input data should be fine. Temperature 
calibration was performed with MetOH in H2O. I eliminated all overlapping 
peaks and fitted the curves with the functions you also provide in relax 
and performed consistency testing which worked well with only three 
outliers.  I eliminated the outliers from the analysis and run your 
protocol again. However, I am worried about model selection since the chi2 
values are very close and I am not confident if the selection procedure 
reflects the true diffusion model. I calculated the diffusion parameters 
with HYDRONMR which gave a ellipsoid model which also came out in the last 
mf runs. I fed this as starting point manually to the program and will now 
perform several manual runs to see if the results are similar to the 
automated.

The local_tm files were always empty in my analyses.

Is there a quick way to write the diffusion tensor parameters to a  .txt 
file? I am new to python...

Regards,

Jonas

Hi Jonas,

Welcome to the relax mailing lists!  From the output, I guess you are using 
the automated model-free analysis protocol (the one I developed and 
published).  Or are you running a custom analysis protocol?  Such results are 
not uncommon and are usually an indication of a bigger problem.  Often this 
comes back to inadequate temperature calibration and/or control - have a 
close look at this text I wrote on the
subject:

    <a  rel="nofollow" href="/manual/Temperature_control_and_calibration.html">http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/Temperature_control_and_calibration.html</a>

Other times it can be due to a bias in the fitting of relaxation curves.  
Which software did you use to calculate the relaxation rates from the base 
data?  Another reason could be the failure of the diffusion tensor 
optimisation due to the specific tensor not being an adequate description of 
reality.  This happens if you have large scale internal motions, partial 
dimerisation (even with 5-10%), long flexible tails, etc.  A good test is to 
use the local_tm global model, which is strangely absent from the above list 
of global models.  The local_tm global model will always be too noisy and 
give some terrible outlier values, but in general it is a good test for the 
diffusion tensor approximation.  As there is no global diffusion assumed, the 
local tm values can adapt to the local diffusion contribution.  The single 
value may be a good enough approximate average value for the spread of 3, 5, 
10 or more global diffusion coefficients.  Therefore if you see the same 
trend in S2 values in the local_tm models as you do in the oblate spheroid, 
then you know that the trend is real.
Whether that real trend is due to the protein system or due to bad input data 
is another question.  Hopefully this helps.

Regards,

Edward

I am a last-year grad student working at a Max Planck Institute in Potsdam, 
Germany. My thesis is concerned with a Ca2+ binding protein. I collected 
full set of backbone relaxation data of the apo and holo form at two fields 
(600 and 750) and saw a slight difference in R2 (about 10% decreased in 
holo form), some difference in R1 (slightly increased in holo form), and no 
change in NOE. However, after I run model free analysis (using the holo 
structure for both apo and holo form since no apo structure is available, 
all 9 local_tm models, and all diffusion models), I saw a global tm 
difference of more than twofold and tremendous changes in s2 values in both 
forms with up to 50% decrease for the holo form. Is this a likely outcome? 
I do not know if I should trust model selection especially since the oblate 
model that was chosen needed about 200 iterations to converge. I used the 
Newton minimizing method. Below, I copied the AIC output from the console 
and the corresponding global tm values.

I'd be happy for any advice!

Thanks in advance,

Jonas

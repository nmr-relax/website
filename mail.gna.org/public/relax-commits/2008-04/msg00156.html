+  abstract       = {Model-free analysis is a technique commonly used
+                   within the field of NMR spectroscopy to extract atomic
+                   resolution, interpretable dynamic information on
+                   multiple timescales from the R (1), R (2), and steady
+                   state NOE. Model-free approaches employ two disparate
+                   areas of data analysis, the discipline of mathematical
+                   optimisation, specifically the minimisation of a chi(2)
+                   function, and the statistical field of model selection.
+                   By searching through a large number of model-free
+                   minimisations, which were setup using synthetic
+                   relaxation data whereby the true underlying dynamics is
+                   known, certain model-free models have been identified
+                   to, at times, fail. This has been characterised as
+                   either the internal correlation times, tau( e ), tau( f
+                   ), or tau( s ), or the global correlation time
+                   parameter, local tau( m ), heading towards infinity,
+                   the result being that the final parameter values are
+                   far from the true values. In a number of cases the
+                   minimised chi(2) value of the failed model is
+                   significantly lower than that of all other models and,
+                   hence, will be the model which is chosen by model
+                   selection techniques. If these models are not removed
+                   prior to model selection the final model-free results
+                   could be far from the truth. By implementing a series
+                   of empirical rules involving inequalities these models
+                   can be specifically isolated and removed. Model-free
+                   analysis should therefore consist of three distinct
+                   steps: model-free minimisation, model-free model
+                   elimination, and finally model-free model selection.
+                   Failure has also been identified to affect the
+                   individual Monte Carlo simulations used within error
+                   analysis. Each simulation involves an independent
+                   randomised relaxation data set and model-free
+                   minimisation, thus simulations suffer from exactly the
+                   same types of failure as model-free models. Therefore,
+                   to prevent these outliers from causing a significant
+                   overestimation of the errors the failed Monte Carlo
+                   simulations need to be culled prior to calculating the

+                   intricately linked to the Brownian rotational diffusion
+                   of the macromolecule. The diffusion tensor parameters
+                   strongly influence the optimisation of the various
+                   model-free models and the subsequent model selection
+                   between them. Finding the optimal model of the dynamics
+                   of the system among the numerous diffusion and
+                   model-free models is hence quite complex. Using set
+                   theory, the entirety of this global problem has been
+                   encapsulated by the universal set Ll, and its
+                   resolution mathematically formulated as the universal
+                   solution Ll. Ever since the original Lipari and Szabo
+                   papers the model-free dynamics of a molecule has most
+                   often been solved by initially estimating the diffusion
+                   tensor. The model-free models which depend on the

+                   model-free parameters is optimised. These steps are
+                   repeated until convergence. For simplicity this
+                   approach to Ll will be labelled the diffusion seeded

+The key to obtaining the model-free description of the dynamics of a
+macromolecule is the optimisation of the model-free and Brownian
+rotational diffusion parameters using the collected R (1), R (2) and
+steady-state NOE relaxation data. The problem of optimising the
+chi-squared value is often assumed to be trivial, however, the long chain
+of dependencies required for its calculation complicates the model-free
+chi-squared space. Convolutions are induced by the Lorentzian form of the
+spectral density functions, the linear recombinations of certain spectral
+density values to obtain the relaxation rates, the calculation of the NOE
+using the ratio of two of these rates, and finally the quadratic form of
+the chi-squared equation itself. Two major topological features of the
+model-free space complicate optimisation. The first is a long, shallow
+valley which commences at infinite correlation times and gradually
+approaches the minimum. The most severe convolution occurs for motions on
+two timescales in which the minimum is often located at the end of a long,
+deep, curved tunnel or multidimensional valley through the space. A large
+number of optimisation algorithms will be investigated and their
+performance compared to determine which techniques are suitable for use in
+model-free analysis. Local optimisation algorithms will be shown to be
+sufficient for minimisation not only within the model-free space but also
+for the minimisation of the Brownian rotational diffusion tensor. In
+addition the performance of the programs Modelfree and Dasha are
+investigated. A number of model-free optimisation failures were
+identified: the inability to slide along the limits, the singular matrix
+failure of the Levenberg-Marquardt minimisation algorithm, the low
+precision of both programs, and a bug in Modelfree. Significantly, the
+singular matrix failure of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm occurs when
+internal correlation times are undefined and is greatly amplified in
+model-free analysis by both the grid search and constraint algorithms. The
+program relax ( <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nmr-relax.com">http://www.nmr-relax.com</a> ) is also presented as a new
+software package designed for the analysis of macromolecular dynamics
+through the use of NMR relaxation data and which alleviates all of the

+Finding the dynamics of an entire macromolecule is a complex problem as
+the model-free parameter values are intricately linked to the Brownian
+rotational diffusion of the molecule, mathematically through the
+autocorrelation function of the motion and statistically through model
+selection. The solution to this problem was formulated using set theory as
+an element of the universal set [Formula: see text]-the union of all
+model-free spaces (d'Auvergne EJ and Gooley PR (2007) Mol BioSyst 3(7),
+483-494). The current procedure commonly used to find the universal
+solution is to initially estimate the diffusion tensor parameters, to
+optimise the model-free parameters of numerous models, and then to choose
+the best model via model selection. The global model is then optimised and
+the procedure repeated until convergence. In this paper a new methodology
+is presented which takes a different approach to this diffusion seeded
+model-free paradigm. Rather than starting with the diffusion tensor this
+iterative protocol begins by optimising the model-free parameters in the
+absence of any global model parameters, selecting between all the
+model-free models, and finally optimising the diffusion tensor. The new
+model-free optimisation protocol will be validated using synthetic data
+from Schurr JM et al. (1994) J Magn Reson B 105(3), 211-224 and the
+relaxation data of the bacteriorhodopsin (1-36)BR fragment from Orekhov VY
+(1999) J Biomol NMR 14(4), 345-356. To demonstrate the importance of this
+new procedure the NMR relaxation data of the Olfactory Marker Protein
+(OMP) of Gitti R et al. (2005) Biochem 44(28), 9673-9679 is reanalysed.
+The result is that the dynamics for certain secondary structural elements
+is very different from those originally reported.}&quot;,

Thanks for the quick response!

Protein 1: I will attempt to troubleshoot using the advice you gave
me. The problem occurs write after it indicates its writing a file for
prolate round_3 (so its about to start it). I will run it again and post
the output to give you a better idea. I'm pretty sure the output was
something like this
Over-fit spin deselection:
No spins have been deselected.
Resetting the minimisation statistics.
But I will double check and send you another email with the actual
output.
Protein 2:
I am using the sample script for dAuvergene protocol. So the only
thing I've changed since my previous run (the one that worked that you
wrote a tutorial for), was the pdb file and the data set I used. The 
thing
I suspected was causing an issue ,was the pdb file since I slightly
modified it, and thats really the only thing different from this run 
versus
the others.

Also side note, if I were to deselect the spins that I don't have data
for or I have bad data for, that wouldn't change any of the calculations
correct? I never have since I assumed relax would just ignore all the 
amino
acids I don't have data for, but it may help increase the speed of my
calculations if I just tell relax to just ignore the spins from the 
start.

Sincerely,
Sam

Happy to hear you that you get some progress.

Protein 1:
Can you help me to find out, if you are minimizing or running
Monte-Carlo simulations?
This COULD be the problem:

How relax works (at least how it works for relaxation dispersion):
Step 1: Minimize the error for the target function. Find the
parameters which best match the target function to the data, by 
minimizing
the error.
Here each individual spin minimization is handed out to a processor
for calculation.

Step 2: Determine the error of the minimization by monte carlo
simulations.
Create (Standard 500) additional datasets with a copy from the
original. Modify each datapoint by an error, drawn from a gaussian
distribution where the width is described by the error of measurements.
Now hand out each of the datasets to the processor. Each processor
should now calculate the minimization for all the spins. The 
minimization
should be more quick, as the starting position is chosen from Step 1.

Possible problem: One (or more) of the spins has really bad data. So
a little change of the data makes the minimization space very 
different.
Think of a flat table. Where should the &quot;minimization ball&quot; run into?
Maybe you have created a small new bump in the table. This is 
typically for
&quot;bad&quot; data.

This could either be the measurement OR the error estimation. Relax
will keep on searching for minimization.
If you are &quot;unlucky&quot;, some of the created datasets will make relax
hang for a very long time.

Unfortunately, it is NOT possible to ask a processor about its
&quot;current&quot; work, when it is doing a minimization for a whole dataset.
And if it was, it would create an output of 64 spins being minimized
at the same time, creating a big mess, since the processors are working
alone. When doing Monte-Carlo simulations, relax are quite silent. Only
reporting when a whole dataset is done.

Is relax stuck in Monte-Carlo simulations?

Possible solution:
*) Set Monte-Carlo simulations to 3 (which is minimum), and know that
you have found the right minimum, but the error estimation of the
parameters are wrong.
*) Carefully inspect your data, deselecting all spins which have &quot;bad
data&quot;. Look at their graphs. Consider working with as few spins as
possible, and work your way up! Working this way will greatly increase 
your
productivity.

Protein 2:
Are you setting the bonds for the minimization manually?
This looks like the upper/lower bonds are specified wrong. This is
not easy to do. How are you doing it?

Best
Troels

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi Troels,

I have successfully been able to run the model-free analysis on 64
cores. The issue appears to have been I simply did not specify the 
spin
number, so after looking at your tutorial and making the proper
modifications, it ran with no complications. The results are somewhat
reasonable. I decided to try to run 2 other proteins however; and 
I've come
across problems for both again.
Protein 1:
I set this up just like the tutorial, and it runs with no warnings
or errors; however, the run never finishes. At round_3 for the prolate
model when it starts to minimize it just stops. I don't mean relax is
stopped or closed, I mean it stops doing any calculations. Relax is 
still
open, and if I run the top command, I can still see something is 
going on
with the other cores, but nothing is being calculated. The run with 64
cores is incredibly fast (under 4 hours), so I don't think it's 
loading
calculations or writing them, and I've left it there for over 24 
hours, and
it's still just sorta stuck. There are no errors, no outputs, it just 
says
its gonna start to minimize and then nothing happens after that.
Protein2:
This protein was a little different since the pdb structure was a
crystal structure. I had to use WhatIf to add the protons onto the pdb
file. The structure appears to load up fine, all the spins appear to 
be
read, data is loaded, vectors and are calculated and define, but when 
I
came to run the protocol this error pops up:

I should mention this error pops up when it decided to calculate the

portion of the calculation (like in the previous bug). Thanks in 
advance.

To tackle this problem, I would advice to create another bug.
Creation and closing of a bug &quot;leaves trails&quot;, which maybe will
help another person, when googling for the same problem.

To help you, can you do a &quot;relax -i&quot; on both computers?
That give some indication about package versions and computer setup.

The first thing we need to establish, is that mpirun is working.
We have to test the installation without relax.

Can you have a look at:
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/OpenMPI">http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/OpenMPI</a>

Try the different things like:
lscpu
mpirun --report-bindings -np 11 echo &quot;hello world&quot;
mpirun --report-bindings -np 4 relax --multi='mpi4py'

When we are confident about this, then we will try make a small
test script for relax.

Please try these things at both computers, and provide 2 files with
commands and output.

Then attach it to the bug report.

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi Troels,

So I saw the tutorial you put, and the main problem was I had not
specified my data was only for the Nitrogen spins. After applying 
the spin
column, my data loaded and relax ran model free with no problem. I 
have a
script that starts and runs relax and model free all automatic, if 
you wish
I can send it via email to you and you can upload it to the 
tutorial wiki
page. So I can successfully run model-free in script mode for a
uni-processor.
The problem now with the multi-processor is that the script won't
load. In the bug page I uploaded a screenshot where I had input the 
'mpirun
-np 4 ../relax --multi='mpi4py' command, however I had no output. I 
checked
processes running in the background, and saw that there was indeed 4
processess running in the background (1 master and 3 slaves) for 
relax; but
there was no output, so I was unable to load any data, or create a 
pipe or
anything. This was only on the Fedora 24 computer, not the Fedora 
20. On
the Fedora 20 computer, I was able to successfully open relax on a 
multi
processor platform. I can send the screenshots and the relax -i for 
both
computers again. I don't know why it doesn't work the fedora 24. Do 
you
know what could be causing this?

Thanks again in advance

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">HI Troels,

So I saw the tutorial you put, and the main problem was I had
not specified my data was only for the Nitrogen spins. After 
applying the
spin column, my data loaded and relax ran model free with no 
problem. I
have a script that starts and runs relax and model free all 
automatic, if
you wish I can send it via email to you and you can upload it to 
the
tutorial wiki page. So I can successfully run model-free in 
script mode for
a uni-processor.
The problem now with the multi-processor is that the script
won't load. In the bug page I uploaded a screenshot where I had 
input the
'mpirun -np 4 ../relax --multi='mpi4py' command, however I had no 
output. I
checked processes running in the background, and saw that there 
was indeed
4 processess running in the background (1 master and 3 slaves) 
for relax;
but there was no output, so I was unable to load any data, or 
create a pipe
or anything. This was only on the Fedora 24 computer, not the 
Fedora 20. On
the Fedora 20 computer, I was able to successfully open relax on 
a multi
processor platform. I can send the screenshots and the relax -i 
for both
computers again. I don't know why it doesn't work the fedora 24. 
Do you
know what could be causing this?

Thanks again in advance
Sam

I closed the 2 bug reports as invalid.

The data is not labelled correct.
But this can be corrected.

Please see this tutorial I wrote:

I hope this give some guidance.

If you experience any new problems, please feel free to ask!!

What you experience, will probably be the same for many.
Your feedback is valuable for the development.

Please wait with using mpirun and multiple processors, before
you are absolutely sure
that it will run on 1 processor.

Bugfixing when using multiple processors is a nightmare....

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi Troels,

Additional question that I had, if you could also look into
this as well on Tuesday please. I have decided to try to 
write a script to
automate this whole process (since I won't be using the gui 
to do model
free), and I've come across a problem. I can successfully 
open up relax
using openmpi, and can load the pdb file, and assign all the 
spins and
isotopes; however, it appears it will only load one data file 
(the very
first one I'll have inputed in the script). I don't know if 
there is a
problem with how I wrote my script. Not only will it not load 
the rest of
my data sets, it won't actually run dAuvergne's protocol 
either, it'll just
load the data set and exit out of the program. Attached is 
the script I
wrote for relax.

This is the output once relax has loaded

script = 'model_free_sample_script.py'

crowlab: [~/relax-4.0.2]&gt;

As you can see, I have all 6 data sets set to load, but only
the very first one appears to do so, and after it loads, it 
just exits out
of relax. Again, I don't know if this is a problem with how I 
wrote the
script. The Relax_script1 is the one that I load up to run 
the whole thing.
The model free script.py is just the script it reads once 
relax has opened
up.  Again, I can see all the spins are properly loaded, and 
the isotopes
are set. It just everything after the first data set that 
doesn't load.
Thanks again in advance.

Sincerely,
Sam

To solve this problem, it would be easier to have
access to some of your data.
Can you upload to: <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?group=relax">https://gna.org/bugs/?group=relax</a>

Take each of your data files, and delete all data,
except 2 spins.
Also provide your script file, or a description of
which button you press in the GUI.

Please also provide information about your system with:
relax -i

Then I will make a tutorial for you. To be added here:
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/Category:Tutorials">http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/Category:Tutorials</a>

If there is a problem in relax, I will write a
systemtest which will solve the problem.
And the problem will never return.

If this a user error, the tutorial should help to
prevent this, and would be the first step before
adding/modifying the manual.

Regarding using mpirun.
Have a look at this page. Maybe it helps.

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Hello everyone,

So I was able to set up and run the
dauvergne_protocol successfully by
using the script in the wiki. The problem I have come
across now is the
program doesn't seem to read my data. Using the gui
interface I was able to
successfully load my data and run it. When I upload
my data using the
script command:
relax_data.read(ri_id='R1_Agne
s',ri_type='R1',frq=599.642*1e6,
file='R1_Agnes',res_num_col=1,data_col=2,error_col=3)

The output file simply gives errors for amino acids I
don't have data for:
RelaxWarning: The sequence data in the line ['1'] is
invalid, the data is
missing.

This is fine as relax just ignores these values and
continues its
calculations. I only receive this warning for values
I don't have data for.
This is the same thing I got when using the gui
interface (the gui however
showed my values that I have data for and the residue
it corresponds to,
using the script I don't receive such an output, I
don't know whether this
is normal or not). However, since I don't get this
warning for every amino
acid, I assume this means it has read the values for
the other amino acids.
All of my data is the same, relax warnings only pop
up for amino acids that
I don't have data for. The problem is, when I enter
the dAuvergne protocol,
I get the protocol working, it starts running
local_tm however it appears
none of my data has been uploaded:
RelaxWarning: The spin '#hRGS7:2@N' has been
deselected because of missing
relaxation data
RelaxWarning: The spin '#hRGS7:3@N' has been
deselected because of missing
relaxation data

And I get that warning for every single amino acid.
From the output, it
appears to have read the file since it knows exactly
which amino acids I
don't have data for, but I don't know why when it
comes to running the
protocol, it tells me I havn't inputed any data. I
have typed everything
directly according to the script from the wiki. From
running the protoco,
it appears everything has properly been uploaded,
structure data, magnetic
dipole interactions, csa, the data pipe, the analysis
variables, the python
module imports, and setting up the spins from the pdb
file. It appears the
only error is from loading the actual relaxation data.

On a completely unrelated side note, I have been
attempting to run relax on
multiple processors. I have tried 2 different
computers, both fedora linux.
I have mpi4py and openmpi downloaded on both. On one,
I can get relax on
multiple cores working (havn't been able to
successfully run it due to
being unable to upload any data properly). On the
other however, I type in
the mpirun -np --multi='mpi4py' script, but I get no
output. I can see that
it's running in the background (top command), but
nothing pops up, no text
command, nothing. I typed the same mpirun with the
--gui, but that opened
up nothing. On a uni-processor (typing in the exact
same command without
indicating how many cores i.e. no -np
--multi='mpi4py') it works just fine,
so I don't think its my openmpi that's an issue. I
don't know whether this
is an issue with my mpi4py or a personal computer
issue (since on the other
computer relax runs just fine on multiple cores).

Sincerely,
Sam

P.S. when I do enter the top command to see what's
running. My master shows
mpirun, and the 3 slaves display python when I put
-np 4, so I know
something is running in the background. I have 8
cores.

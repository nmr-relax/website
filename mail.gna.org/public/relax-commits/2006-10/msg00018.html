+
+
+
+1.  All managers
+
+The following are tasks common to all the manager positions.
+
+
+1.1  Documentation
+
+An important part of the job of the relax managers is to document all the 
actions performed as the manager and to keep the job descriptions below up to 
date.  This file will constantly evolve as the manager positions are refined. 
 There may also be tasks or details missing from the descriptions.  This is 
an important task as it allows the next volunteer to easily take over when a 
transition occurs.
+
+
+1.2  Transitions
+
+The management position can be passed on by request at any time.  This may 
be because you would like to move onto another job, if job becomes too 
demanding, or if you do not currently have the time to contribute to the 
project.
+
+
+
+
+
+2.  The mailing list manager
+
+This position is currently held by Chris MacRaild (c.a.macraild at 
leeds.ac.uk).
+
+
+2.1  Tasks
+
+2.1.1  Configuration
+
+Part of the job is to change the mailing list settings as necessary.  This 
is a relatively infrequent task.  The changes should be discussed on the 
relax-devel mailing list first so that subscribers are aware that a change 
may soon occur.  Changes to relax-users and relax-devel should also be 
announced prior to the event.
+
+2.1.2  Spam
+
+All four mailing lists (relax-announce, relax-users, relax-devel, and 
relax-commits) are moderated - only members can post to the lists.  Posts by 
non-subscribers are first sent to the Mailing List Manager for approval, 
denial, rejection, etc.  The number of spam messages are low because all 
posts must first pass through Gna's blacklists and SpamAssassin 
(<a  href="https://gna.org/cookbook/?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=112">https://gna.org/cookbook/?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=112</a>).
+
+2.1.3  Rejection
+
+All posts to relax-announce and relax-commits are to be rejected.  The 
exceptions are posts to relax-announce by the Project Administrator and posts 
to relax-commits by the subversion and CVS relax repositories 
(<a  href="https://gna.org/svn/?group=relax">https://gna.org/svn/?group=relax</a> and <a  href="https://gna.org/cvs/?group=relax">https://gna.org/cvs/?group=relax</a>).  The 
repository commit messages are currently automatically accepted.
+
+2.1.4  Acceptance
+
+Non-member posts to relax-users or relax-devel should be quickly accepted if 
they are legitimate.  The poster will receive an automatic email saying that 
the list is for members only and that the email is awaiting approval.  Even 
if the poster subsequently subscribes to the list, their post should 
nevertheless be accepted by the manager as it will still be waiting for 
approval.
+
+2.1.5  Redirection
+
+If people have sent the message to the wrong forum (a post talking about 
source code modifications is sent to relax-user, somebody accidentally 
sending a message to relax-announce or relax-commits when it should be sent 
to one of the other lists, or program usage questions which are sent to 
relax-users, etc.) then redirection is necessary.  To do this, the person 
should be politely asked to repost the message to the relevant forum.  This 
should be done publicly as a reply to their original post unless the message 
was sent to relax-announce or relax-commits.
+
+If somebody reports a bug on one of the mailing lists, then the Mailing List 
Manager should politely ask the person if they would like to create a bug 
report (pointing them to the bug tracker at <a  href="https://gna.org/bugs/?group=relax">https://gna.org/bugs/?group=relax</a> 
or the bug submission page <a  href="https://gna.org/bugs/?func=additem&amp;group=relax">https://gna.org/bugs/?func=additem&amp;group=relax</a>).  
In the post the person should be directed to the relevant section of the 
manual describing how to submit a bug report (both the PDF and HTML 
versions).  It is quite likely that the poster won't take the time to create 
the report.  If that is the case then the Mailing List Manager should create 
a report pointing to the original post.  An example of this is bug #6873 
(<a  href="https://gna.org/bugs/?6873">https://gna.org/bugs/?6873</a>).  Redirection is not an exclusive job, anyone 
can request redirection, however if no one responds then the Mailing List 
Manager should make the request.
+
+2.1.6  Invitation
+
+Some people subscribe solely to relax-users or relax-devel.  Any subscribers 
to these two lists should probably also be subscribed to relax-announce.  If 
there are people who receive messages from the other lists but are not 
subscribed to relax-announce then, from the relax-announce mailman 
configuration page, they should politely be asked if they would like to 
subscribe to relax-announce.  Only new subscribers should be invited.
+
+2.1.7  Sharing the job
+
+Importantly these tasks are not the exclusive domain of the Mailing List 
Manager.  Everyone is free to do any part of the task description.  The job 
of the manager is to make sure that these things occur if no one picks up the 
slack.  However, the first four tasks require the administrative password so 
only the Manager and the Project Admin can do these tasks.
+
+
+2.2  Email addresses
+
+The Mailing List Manager is a position of trust.  The manager has full 
access to the email addresses and names of all subscribers.  These details 
must not be used in any way or the information disclosed to anyone.  In 
addition, people's settings should not be changed.  If someone has their 
settings incorrect, then they should fix the problem.  A private message 
describing the problem and presenting yourself as the Mailing List Manager 
can be sent.
+
+
+2.3  Administrative passwords
+
+The passwords for the administrative pages of all four mailing lists are to 
be kept by both the Mailing List Manager and Project Admin.  Although the 
Project Admin can still perform all the tasks of the manager, all the tasks 
should be left for the Mailing List Manager.  By both people having access to 
the administrative interface, Project Admin can clear messages when the 
Mailing List Manager is away or at any other time requested.

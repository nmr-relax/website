I just did it...
Thanks for the suggestion.

Hi Seb,

I have just performed a little clean up of the &quot;Consistency testing&quot;
chapter of the relax manual.  This is now in a pretty good shape to
ship out to users.  I was wondering if you'd like to add some small
text as the end, a last paragraph maybe, explaining why the script
generates the F_eta and F_R2 values.  From reading the references,
this is obvious.  But if a user reads this chapter as it is before
jumping to your papers, they will be confused.

Cheers,

Edward

-As shown in Figure \ref{fig: consistency analysis}, the example data 
displays both consistent and inconsistent data. In fact, data recorded at 500 
MHz and 600 MHz are consistent together, whereas data recorded at 800 MHz is 
not consistent with data recorded at 500 MHz nor 600 MHz.  Since more than 
two magnetic fields were used, this allowed the identification of the data 
from 800 MHz  as the inconsistent data, as data from 500 MHz is consistent 
with data from 600 MHz, and vice-versa.  In this particular example, this 
allowed the authors to take special care with data at 800 MHz.
-
-This inconsistency of 800 MHz data is seen on the correlation plot (toop) by 
a deviation from the dotted line (which represents the theoretical situation 
when equal $J(0)$ values are extracted from both magnetic fields. It is also 
observable in the histogram (bottom) where the ration of the data from two 
magnetic fields is not centered around 0. In fact, there seems to be a 
systematic shift of the calculated $J(0)$ values at 800 MHz when compared to 
the two other magnetic fields. This is caused by a similar shift in the 
experimental $R_2$ (transversal relaxation rate) data.

-For the 500 MHz and 600 MHz data pair, the data are centered around the 
dotted line in the correlation plot (approach A, top left) as well as 
centered around a value of 1 in the histogram comparing the ratios of values 
from both magnetic fields (approach B, bottom left). Of course, there are 
some outsider values even in the case of consistent data. There are caused by 
specific dynamic characteristics of these spins and are different from 
systematic inconsistencies such as depicted in the example above with the 
data recorded at 800 MHz.

<pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi Ed,

I tried what you proposed...

========================
from generic_fns.mol_res_spin import spin_loop
pipe.create()
sequence.read()
structure.read_pdb()
structure.vectors()
for spin, spin_id in spin_loop(return_id=True):
    print &quot;%s %s&quot; % (spin_id, spin.xh_vect)
========================

However, there is something quite annoying (but predictable)... If the
sequence used contains residues for which the N-H vector does not exist
(e.g. N-terminal residue, or proline), the spin loop will produce an
error message such as:

========================
for spin, spin_id in spin_loop(return_id=True):
    print &quot;%s %s&quot; % (spin_id, spin.xh_vect)

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;console&gt;&quot;, line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
AttributeError: 'SpinContainer' object has no attribute 'xh_vect'
========================

Using the function 'deselect_read()' does not solve this problem...

One way to avoid this is to read a sequence not including the spins
without attached spin... However, the ideal would be to have relax
output something like:

========================
:141&amp;:ala@N [ 0.8840636   0.0631474   0.46308093]
:142&amp;:pro@N [ None None None]
...
========================

What do you think ? Is that some bug ?

Maybe, also, we could add a system test and a sample script for this
kind of analysis which could be useful to some people...

Regards,


Sébastien  :)

for spin, spin_id in spin_loop(return_id=True):
    print &quot;%s %s&quot; % (spin_id, spin.xh_vect)

So you know which molecule/residue/atom you are looking at.

relax already stores all the bond vectors in the spin container, if
the ave argument to structure.vectors() is set to False and multiple
models are loaded.  There's nothing to dump these values to a file yet
though (value.write() I don't think can output lists or vectors), or
nothing to really process these vectors.  A script skeleton that could
access all these vectors though would be something like:

from generic_fns.mol_res_spin import spin_loop
pipe.create()
structure.read_pdb()
structure.vectors()
for spin in spin_loop():
   print spin.xh_vect

This gives you access to the data you require - you just have to set
up the arguments correctly and dump the data as you wish.

Edward

Thanks for the detailed and rapid answer !

These functionalities would be great ! The use of X-H vectors
orientations spread could be used in cases where several structures are
present to assess flexibility from different structures ! This would
allow a better use of these structures, but also a better
rationalization of NMR dynamics !

I propose these ideas could be added in the (already quite long) todo
list...  ;)

As for what will soon be possible within relax, i.e. the possibility for
the spin container to be filled with a list of orientations, how would
you use relax to extract these orientations and output a list for each
spin ? Is there a sample script for doing something like that ? This
would be useful for someone interested in getting the orientations and
analysing them out of relax, until the code is present...  ;)

Regards,


Séb   :)

I'm actually changing that code at the moment.  If you follow my
commit messages you'll see how this will be handled in relax, very
soon.  The changes are happening in the multi_structure branch where I
am introducing the distinction between different models (the same
molecules but with different conformations) verses different molecules
within one model.  I'm modifying the structure.vectors() user function
now, and this is probably the one you are interested in.  Using this
function, you can extract the vectors from all different models and
these will be placed in the spin container.  With the 'ave' arg set to
False, each spin container will have a list of 3D vectors for all
models.

As for analysing the spread of these vectors and then doing something
with that, nothing is present in relax.  If you would like to have
this functionality, a little work will need to be done and a few
algorithms designed.  The eliminate() user function for deselecting
spins is close but not quite what you need.  It accepts an arbitrary
function but is not the correct place for this idea.  Better would be
something like:

deselect.mobile()
deselect.structural_noise()
deselect.vectors()
deselect.spread_vectors()

with an argument such as (vector_spread_cutoff=0.53), where 0.53 is
some measure of the spread.  This might be expandable to B-factors.
If the name deselect.mobile() is used, this could cover a vector
spread, B-factors, low S2 values, etc.  Oh, with the deselect user
functions, there should always be a counterpart in the select user
function class.  This will allow the deselected spins of the first
analysis to be used in a second with local tm values rather than a
global diffusion tensor.  Is this what you had in mind?

Regards,

Edward

We are currently studying a system for which many structures are 
available.

We thought it would be a great idea to compare X-H (N-H in our case)
orientations to spot residues for which the orientation varies  in the
different structures, i.e. for which there might be important motions.

We thought this could be useful to eliminate such residues with
tremendous motions from diffusion tensor optimization and test them as
diffusing independently (local tm).

Is there a way to do that in relax ?

We saw the sample script 'xh_vector_dist.py' which allows one to plot
the vector orientations distribution. However, what we would like to get
would be a file containing the orientations which could allow us to
compare different structures quantitatively on a per residue basis...

Thanks for help !

<pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi,

This addition was for the relaxation dispersion analysis and is in
section 10.14.2 &quot;Dispersion GUI mode - computation time&quot;.  The text
is:

&quot;The time required to complete these two analyses is highly dependent
on the computer being used as well as how many nodes can be used for
running the calculations parallelised with OpenMPI. On a large cluster
with many nodes both analyses should be completed in under an hour.
But when running the analyses without OpenMPI on old single core
computer, the analyses could take days and even up to a week.&quot;

For a model-free analysis, the computation time might range from 1 day
to 2 weeks, depending on how interesting the molecule is from a
dynamics perspective (the more dynamic, the more difficult the
problem) and if Gary Thompson's multi-processor with OpenMPI is used.

Regards,

Edward

I remember that Edward added a section to the manual about running time, and
probably somewhere on the relax mailing list that question is answered.

But it depends on how many spins, computer power, and how many CPU.

But I think that anything between a day and a week is expected (best guess
is a week ? )
Especially for model-free analysis.

Dear Edward and Troels,

Thanks for all your suggestions - they have all been really helpful. I
have now added the errors onto the T1/T2/NOE lists (I use CCPNmr Analysis).

Just one more question (maybe a stupid one) - how long does it take to do
the full model free analysis (I just use the default settings on the GUI).
Its been running for more than 6 hours now and the 'Incremental progress' 
is
still showing less than 30% completion

Thanks

Ivan

Subject: Re: Model-free analysis error

Hi Ivan and Troels,

Continuing from
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.devel/5263/focus=5268">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.devel/5263/focus=5268</a>,
the default error of 1.0 is important.  This causes the chi-square
value to collapse into the sum of squared errors (SSE), making the
analysis still possible.  However the real errors should really be
provided at all times.  A model-free analysis requires the greatest
precision and accuracy of all NMR analysis types.  Not providing
errors, i.e. using crude errors of 1.0, for all data will really fubar
your results (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_slang#FUBAR">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_slang#FUBAR</a>).  If
these are not available, please use the relaxation curve-fitting and
steady-state NOE analyses in relax to properly calculate relaxation
data errors from either replicated spectra or the base plane noise
(see the 'rm' command in Sparky or the equivalent in other software).
These peak intensity errors do not linearly map to the relaxation
data, hence why different errors for all data points is rather
important.

Regards,

Edward

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Cheers!  I can confirm the problem - the identification of the @N and
@H atom pairs takes a long, long time.  However it does successfully
complete after a few minutes.  There are two problems I can identify.
Solving the first will be the easiest.  From the saved state file that
you uploaded, I can see that you have loaded all atoms of the PDB file
into relax as nuclear spins.  For your analysis this is not necessary,
just load the @N and @H atoms.  Then the interatom.define user
function will operate much faster as then it will not need to loop
over all these 1231 atoms (1231^2 times) but only the 296 @H and @N
atoms.  See
<a  rel="nofollow" href="/manual/d_Auvergne_protocol_GUI_mode_setting_up_spin.html">http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/d_Auvergne_protocol_GUI_mode_setting_up_spin.html</a>
and
<a  rel="nofollow" href="/manual/GUI_mode_spins_from_structural_data.html">http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/GUI_mode_spins_from_structural_data.html</a>
for more details (the PDF version of the manual at
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://download.gna.org/relax/manual/relax.pdf">http://download.gna.org/relax/manual/relax.pdf</a> is of higher quality).

The second problem is in relax.  There must be an inefficiency
somewhere in the relax code which causes this to take so long.  I'll
look and see if this function can be sped up, but it might require
modifying the internal PDB reader in relax to automatically determine
connected atoms for the standard protein/DNA/RNA residues.  Fixing
this is a lot of work, so the first option might be fastest for you.
As connected atoms in the protein were not automatically detected by
the relax PDB reader, relax must first loop over each atoms to check
for connections and for each it must then loop over all other atoms
and determine if those atoms are within a certain short distance.  If
so, it will consider the atoms to be bonded.  Because of these two
nested loops, for 1231 atoms there would be 1231^2 = 1515361
interatomic distance checks.  This is why it is slow.  For just the @N
and @H spins the number of checks would be ~20 times less.

Regards,

Edward


P. S.  For any relax developers out there, the fix is to support the
standard PDB atom naming in the Chemical Component Dictionary, as
described in <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/format33/sect9.html#ATOM">http://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/format33/sect9.html#ATOM</a>
and found at <a  rel="nofollow" href="ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/data/monomers/">ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/data/monomers/</a>.  The ATOM
records in a PDB file must conform to this nomenclature and the given
CONECT records.  All the definitions are in the single file
<a  rel="nofollow" href="ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/data/monomers/het_dictionary.txt">ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/data/monomers/het_dictionary.txt</a>.  For
example to see glycine, search for &quot;HET    GLY&quot;.  The number of spaces
is essential here.  We could add the standard amino acid HET
dictionaries to relax and use the CONECT records in these to bond all
atoms together.  Some problems are that in X-ray structures certain
random atoms will be missing and that encountering non-standard or
modified amino acids is not uncommon.  Therefore the distance-based
algorithm would be always needed as a fallback if the relax PDB reader
does not find connected atoms for a given atom.

Hi Ivan,

If you could create a bug report using the link
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/bugs/?func=additem&amp;group=relax">https://gna.org/bugs/?func=additem&amp;group=relax</a>, that would be
appreciated.  Please try to include as much information as possible.
The best would be if you could attach a truncated data set, the
minimum required to trigger the bug (slightly randomised if you would
like to keep it private).  If I can reproduce the bug myself, I can
normally have a fix for it within 5-10 minutes.  Oh, it would be good
to check that you are using the latest version of relax - currently
3.1.6 (<a  rel="nofollow" href="/download.html">http://www.nmr-relax.com/download.html</a>) - just in case the bug
has already been fixed.

Cheers,

I have now conducted measurements (T1, T2 and NOE) in two seperate
fields (600 and 700 MHz) as suggested in your previous email.

I have upload six different files onto the &quot;Relaxation Data List&quot;. The
data is in the following format

2 ALA 5.49631746729691 N
3 ASP 3.74279511939516 N
4 ASP 6.12594952217594 N
6 SER 6.75812664729337 N

However, after I click the &quot;Dipolar relaxation&quot; button, the programme
freezes up when I press &quot;Apply&quot; or &quot;Next&quot;.

I encountered no problem with the other three buttons (CSA relaxation
/ X isotope / H isotope)

I wonder if it is because I am not supplying the right type of data to
the software, or if this is a python problem?

Thanks and I hope to hear back from you soon!

Ivan

These will have lots of additional information.  This is just a
selection of possibly the most useful messages.


You will soon see that this is a complicated topic.  Note that relax
is capable of performing 100% of the functionality of Modelfree4 (with
or without the Fast-Modelfree GUI interface), Dasha, Tensor2, and
DYNAMICS.  If you play with the optimisation settings you can even
find identical results to within machine precision - relax can mimic
these other softwares.

The key is that the full analysis protocol is rather complicated -
many people don't understand this - and that these softwares do not
implement the full iterative protocol.  Therefore you either have to
perform it manually or write a script to perform all of the steps.
The protocol is described in the relax manual in figure 7.2
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="/manual/diffusion_seeded_paradigm.html">http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/diffusion_seeded_paradigm.html</a>).  In
summary:

a)  Find an initial diffusion tensor estimate (you can do this in
relax by only using model m0).  This requires all non-mobile residues
and side chain spins to be excluded, and this can be problematic.  See
the d'Auvergne and Gooley, 2008b paper at
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10858-007-9213-3">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10858-007-9213-3</a> for an example of the
catastrophic failure that this initial estimate can result in.  Or the
bacteriorhodopsin fragment of Korzhnev et al., 1999
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/a:1008356809071">http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/a:1008356809071</a>) where this complete
failure was earlier demonstrated.

b)  Optimise all of the model-free models from m0 to m9.  This
requires high precision optimisation, for a comparison of all the
softwares see the d'Auvergne and Gooley, 2008a model-free optimisation
paper at <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10858-007-9214-2">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10858-007-9214-2</a>.  Only relax and
Dasha implement the full range of model-free models, though the models
m6, m7, and m8 cannot be used if only single field strength data is
used (m6 is the original 2-time scale motion model of Clore et al.,
1990).

c)  Eliminate failed models (this is only available in relax, see the
d'Auvergne and Gooley, 2006 model elimination paper at
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10858-006-9007-z">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10858-006-9007-z</a>).

d)  Select the best model-free model for each spin system.  This again
requires precision modern techniques, with the best being AIC model
select (see the d'Auvergne and Gooley, 2003 model-free model selection
paper at <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1021902006114">http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1021902006114</a>).  If you are
unaware that ANOVA statistics for model selection (hypothesis testing
via chi-squared, F- and t-tests) was abandoned by the field of model
selection over 100 years ago (a field which makes the NMR field look
very, very small), then you should really look at that paper.

e)  Optimise the global model.  This is the diffusion tensor plus the
model-free models for all spin systems.

f)  Check for convergence (identical chi-squared values to a previous
iteration, and not necessarily the last one).  If no, then go back to
b) and repeat.  Note that the chi-squared value can go up
significantly between iterations, but this is because the model is
simplifying itself at a much faster rate by loosing parameters - it's
Occam's razor at work.  Again see the d'Auvergne and Gooley, 2008b
paper at <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10858-007-9213-3">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10858-007-9213-3</a> for figures
demonstrating this.  The concept as to what is happening during this
combined model-free optimisation and model selection algorithm is
described in the d'Auvergne and Gooley, 2007 MolBiosyst paper at
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b702202f">http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b702202f</a>.  It can take up to 20 iterations
or more to reach convergence, depending upon the quality of the
relaxation data and the 3D structure or the system in study.

g)  Once steps a-f have been completed for all global models
(characterised by the spheroid, prolate spheroid, oblate spheroid, and
ellipsoid diffusion tensors), then model selection between the
different global models needs to be performed.

h)  Monte Carlo simulations for error analysis must be performed at
the end.

i)  Elimination of failed Monte Carlo simulations is essential for
keeping the errors to reasonable values for certain spin systems.
This is also a relax-only feature (see the d'Auvergne and Gooley, 2007
model elimination paper at
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10858-006-9007-z">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10858-006-9007-z</a>).

These steps must be implemented independently of which software you
use, as NONE implement the full protocol.  Note however that the
protocol I developed (in the d'Auvergne and Gooley, 2007 theory paper
at <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b702202f">http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b702202f</a> and the d'Auvergne and Gooley,
2008b paper at <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10858-007-9213-3">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10858-007-9213-3</a>) is fully
implemented in relax, however this required multiple field strength
data.  This is a rather large script located at
auto_anlayses/dauvergne_protocol.py.  This protocol is used by the
GUI.  So one option would be to copy this
auto_anlayses/dauvergne_protocol.py script and modify it for the
figure 7.2 protocol.


*** Note *** I must warn you about using single field strength data.
It is now quite difficult to publish a model-free analysis with only
single field strength data as most of the field know about the
catastrophic analysis failures resulting in large amounts of
artificial motion.  These failures can also be much more subtle.  Many
reviewers will ask for such data to be collected as the results cannot
not be trusted otherwise.  For a model-free analysis, it is almost
essential to collect data at multiple field strengths, otherwise it
can be sometimes impossible to distinguish between the anisotropic
part of the Brownian tumbling of the molecule and internal motion -
specifically due to the NH vectors in secondary structure elements all
pointing in a similar direction.  I have a much better explanation, as
well as citations to all the relevant literature in:

d'Auvergne E. J., Gooley P. R. (2007). Set theory formulation of the
model-free problem and the diffusion seeded model-free paradigm. Mol.
Biosyst., 3(7), 483-494. (<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b702202f">http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b702202f</a>)

In this paper, you will see reviewed both the artificial nanosecond
motions of the Schurr 1994 paper and the artifical Rex motions of the
Tjandra 1995 paper.

Finally, you will probably find it much easier to spend the 7-8 days
collecting data at another field strength than to implement the
protocol of steps a-i in a relax, Modelfree4, or Dasha script (or via
multiple iterations of the GUI programs), as well as study all of the
relevant literature to understand all of the types of failures than
only occurs with single field strength data.  With multiple field
strength data you can perform Sebastien Morin's consistency testing
analysis in relax (<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10858-009-9381-4">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10858-009-9381-4</a> and
<a  rel="nofollow" href="/manual/Consistency_testing.html">http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/Consistency_testing.html</a>).  That way
you can see if your per-experiment temperature calibration and
per-experiment temperature control techniques have works sufficiently
well
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="/manual/Temperature_control_calibration.html">http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/Temperature_control_calibration.html</a>)
and if you have used long enough recycle delays.  Collecting data at a
second field would probably save you significant amounts of time, and
has the additional benefit that it would guarantee that the dynamics
you see at the end will be real.  I cannot emphasize enough how
important it is to collect data at multiple fields, most importantly
the NOE and R2 data.

Edward

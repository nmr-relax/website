</div><div>I have tried modifying the pdb file, but still I get the same warning no matter. I don&#39;t know how to fix this problem, please help me if it is possible. I also went through the archive messages and I saw someone else was encountering with similar problem and the reply message mentioned that the latest version of relax has solved the bug. However, I am using the latest version of relax, and still come across with the RelaxWarning. <br>

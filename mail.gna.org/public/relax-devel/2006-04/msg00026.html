may be better to resend the email rather than forwarding it as your

may be possible to just remove the forwarding junk in the email, I'm
not sure how the 'Message ID' tag in the headers work.

go, it should speed up your model-free runs using relax.  The changes
will necessarily be extensive and will cause breakages while
development occurs, so Gary if you decide to go forwards with it, I
will probably fork relax and create an unstable development branch
called 1.3 where all new developments will go.  It might even be a
good idea to create a private branch for your changes from 1.3.  I
will then reserve 1.2 for bug fixes only.

(while still retaining the Python code as an option),

and I guess mf.py would be the one to hit first... The  questions are
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

The translation to C was just a suggestion as, computationally wise,
the change would be a significant improvement.  It would decrease the
computation time on each node of the cluster however it is a lot of
work and is inessential for clustering.  Please don't fell obliged to
even start this mammoth task.

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">

1. do we need to do all of it or could we just wrap the maths intensive
parts and leave the object creation and management in python
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

If the 'profile_flag' at the end of the 'relax' file in the base
directory is changed to 1, you can see the relative computational
requirements of the various bits of code.  To obtain the full benefits
of C, it would all need to be translated.

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">2. Is there a low level test suite so conformity of python and C code
can be verified
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

The test suite is very primitive and basic at the moment.  A large
number of tests would need to be added to cover all parameter
combinations.  These would need to cover all four types of model-free
minimisation:  the model-free parameters for one residue, the
model-free parameters together with a local tm parameter, the
diffusion parameters for all residues, and all parameters
simultaneously.

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">3. would it be better to do it in pytrex rather than straight C? I guess
the thing to do would be to test it out and see what the quality of the
C code is like
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

I would prefer to stay with proper C using the standard Python/C API. 
I've played with
Pyrex (pytrex is XML I think), Swig, and a few other interfaces but I
don't believe that these will give the full speed ups of the raw
interface.  The number crunching is very low level and using these
high level interfaces is an overkill.

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">which may give
potential gains of 10 to 20 times increased performance.  This code is
by far the most CPU intensive, the minimisation code isn't anywhere
near as expensive.


</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">yep seems logical, the only question is have you profiled? Chris was
trying to do some before the break and there didn't seem to be any
really hot spots.. but I maybe misreading the rumour mill (He is of
course a gargantuan 5 feet way much of the time ;-) Chris any comments?
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

The profile flag at the bottom of the file 'relax' will do it. 
Although a line by line translation will almost produce functional
code (when mixed with the concepts in the relaxation curve-fitting C
code together with the creation of a large struct called 'data'), it
is still a huge effort so only play with it if you really want to.

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">The framework currently in place is the threading code.  The way the
threading code works is through SSH tunnels.  It starts a new instance
of relax on the remote machine (or local if there are a number of CPUs
or CPU cores), that instance gets data sent to it, does the
calculation, and returns the result.  It does work, although it's not
very good at catching failures.  I haven't used it lately so I don't
know if it's broken.


</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">Thats generally the idea I had, i.e. a fairly course grained approach.
My thought was to add constructs to the top level commands (if needed)
to allow allow subsets of a set of calculations to be run from a script.
i.e. part of a grid search or a few monte carlo runs or a subset of
minimisations for a set of residues. Then the real script would generate
the required subscripts plus embedded data on the fly. I think this
provides a considerable degree of flexibility. Thus for instance our
cluster which runs grid engine needs a master script to start all the
sub processes rather than a set of separate password less ssh logons
which a cluster of workstations would require. In general I thought that
catching failures other than a failure to start is not required...
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Is your idea similar to having the runs themselves threaded so instead
of looping over them you run them simultaneously?  I don't know too
much about clustering.  What is the interface by which data and
instructions are sent and returned from the nodes?  And do you know if
there are python wrappings?

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">SSH tunnels is probably not the best option for your system.  Do you
know anything about MPI?

</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">I have read about MPI but have not implimented anything __YET__;-). Also
I have compiled some MPI based programs. It seems to a bit of a pig and
I don't think the low hanging fruit necessarily require that degree of
fine grained distribution...
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

I haven't used MPI either.  There may be much better protocols
implemented for Python.

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">There are a number of options available for
distributed calculations, but it will need to have a clean and stable
Python interface.

</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">obviously a stable interface with as little change to the current top
level functions and as little suprise as possible is to be desired. I
thought it might be a good idea  to have some form of facade, so  that
the various forms of coarse grained multi processing looks the same,
whichever one you are using. The idea would be only to have the setup
and dispach code different.

</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

It would probably be best to use some existing standard protocol
rather than inventing a relax specific system.

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Which ever system is decided upon, threading inside
the program will probably be necessary so that each thread can be sent
to a different machine.  This requires calculations which can be
parallelised.  As minimisation is an iterative process with each
iteration requiring the results of the previous, and as it's not the
most CPU intensive part anyway, I can't see too many gains in
modifying that code.

</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">Agreed

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">I've already parallelised the Monte Carlo
simulations for the threading code as those calculations are the most
obvious target.

</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

They are a time hog
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Grid searching model m8 {S2, tf, S2f, ts, Rex} probably beats the
total of the MC sims (unless the data is dodgy).

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">But all residue specific calculations could be
parellelised as well.  This is probably where you can get the best
speed ups.

</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">Yes that and grid searches seem obvious candidates

</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

I was thinking more along the lines of splitting the residues rather
than the grid search increments.  These increments could be threaded
however the approach would need to be conservative.  I'm planning on
eventually splitting out the minimisation code as a separate project
on Gna! as a Python optimisation library.  The optimisers in Scipy are
useless!

   I was we have a 148 processor beowolf cluster ;-) I was thinking of
having a go at developing a distributed version of relax... are you ok
with that or do you have plans of your own?

The general idea was to have scripts look almost as they are but

1. have  a command to register multi processor handlers


</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

The user function class 'threading' is probably close to what you want.


</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">I shall have a look at it

</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Actually it's called 'thread'.

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">2. have a command to add machines and parameters to the multi processor

threading.add() is probably a good template.




</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">again I shall have a read

</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

I got the wrong name again.  It's 'threading.read', 'threading.add'
hasn't been written yet!

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">3. add code to the generic functions/or replace the generic funcntions

</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

'generic/minimise.py' is the best bet.  Otherwise there is
'maths_fns/mf.py' which can be hacked.


</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">more reading ;-)

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">4. add  code to multiplex the results back together again


</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

That should be pretty straight forward.



</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">obviously this would just be a prototype at first but it could be rather
useful
</pre></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

The use of published standards and low level protocols would be best
to keep the calculations bug free and fast.  For debugging, it might
be worth considering adding threading tests to the test suite.

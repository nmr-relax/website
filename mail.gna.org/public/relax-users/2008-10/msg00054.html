<pre style="margin: 0em;">Oh, I forgot about the std error formula.  Is where the sqrt(2) comes
from?  Doh, that would be retarded.  Then I know someone who would
require sqrt(3) for the NOE spectra!  Is that really what Palmer
meant, that std error is the same as &quot;the standard deviation of the
differences between the heights of corresponding peaks in the paired
spectra&quot; which &quot;is equal to sqrt(2)*sigma&quot; (Palmer et al., 1991)?

I'm pretty sure though that the standard error is not the measure we
want for the confidence interval of the peak intensity.  The reason is
because I think that the std error is a measure of how far the sample
mean is from the true mean (ignore this, this is a quick reference for
myself: <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error_">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error_</a>(statistics) ).
(Warning, from here to the end of the paragraph is a rant!) This is
similar in concept to AIC model selection (see
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion</a> and
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_selection">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_selection</a> if you haven't heard
about the advanced statistical field of model selection before).  AIC
is a little more advanced though as it estimates the Kullback-Leibler
discrepancy (<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback–Leibler_divergence">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback–Leibler_divergence</a>)
which is a measure of distance between the true distribution and the
back-calculated distribution using all information about the
distribution.  Ok, that wasn't too relevant.  Anyway, the std error as
a measure of the differences in means of 2 different distributions is
not a measure of the spread of either the true, measured, or
back-calculated distributions (or the 4th distribution, the
back-calculated from the fit to the true model).  The std error is not
the confidence intervals of any of these 4 distributions, just the
difference between 2 of them using only a small part of the
information of those distributions.  It's the statistical measure of
the difference in means of the true and measured distributions.  As an
aside, for those completely lost now a clearer explanation of these 4
distributions fundamental to data analysis, likelihood, discrepancies,
etc. can be read in section 2.2 of my PhD thesis at
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dtl.unimelb.edu.au:80/R/-?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;amp;object_id=67077&amp;amp;current_base=GEN01">http://dtl.unimelb.edu.au:80/R/-?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;amp;object_id=67077&amp;amp;current_base=GEN01</a>

(sorry for the blatant plug ;).  Oh, the best way to picture all of
these concepts and the links between them is to draw and label 4
distributions on a piece of paper on the same x and y-axes with not
too much overlap between them and connect them with arrows labelled
with all the weird terminology.

Sorry, that was just a long way of saying that the std error is the
quality of how the sample mean matches the real mean and how the
standard deviation is the spread of the distribution.  That being so,
I would avoid setting the standard error as the peak height
uncertainty.  Maybe it would be best to do as you say Chris, and also
avoid the averaging of the replicated intensities.

So, now to the dirty statistics required for the sparse sampling
caused by lack of NMR time.  We can use the standard deviation formula
- the measure of the spread of the measured distribution which is the
estimator of the spread of the true distribution that optimisation
(which is chi-squared fitting and hence finding the maximal likelihood
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood</a>)), Monte Carlo
simulations, and the frequentist model selection techniques all
utilise as the foundation for their fundamental derivations.  We would
then square this to get the variance:

sigma^2 = sum({Ii - Iav}^2) / (n - 1).

In my previous posts I was saying sigma was the variance, but just
ignore that.  Next we need to average the variance across all spins,
simply because the sample size is so low for each peak and hence the
error estimate is horrible.  Whether this estimator of the true
variance is good or bad is debatable (well, actually, it's bad), but
it is unavoidable.  It also has the obvious disadvantage in that the
peak height error is, in reality, different for each peak.

Now, if not all spectra are replicated, then the approach needs to be
modified to give us errors for the peaks of the single spectra.  Each
averaged replicated time point (spectrum) has a single error
associated with it, the average variance.  These are usually different
for different time points, in some cases weakly decreasing
exponentially.  So I think we should average the average variances and
have a single measure of spread for all peaks in all spectra.  This
estimator of the variance is again bad.  Interpolation might be
better, but is still not great.

Cheers,

Edward


P.S.  None of this affects an analysis using peak heights of
non-replicated spectra and the RMSD of the baseplane noise.  But if
someone wants to use the peak volume as a measure of peak intensity,
then we have a statistical problem.  Until someone finds a reference
or derives the formula for how the RMSD of the base plane noise
relates to volume error, then peak heights will be essential for error
analysis.  I'm also willing to be corrected on any of the statistics
above as I'm not an expert in this and may have missed some
fundamental connections between theories.  And there may be a less
'dirty' way of doing the dirty part of the statistics.

I have a general question about curve fitting within relax.

Let's say I proceed to curve fitting for some relaxation rates
(exponential decay) and that I have a duplicate delay for error 
estimation.

========
delays

0.01
0.01
0.02
0.04
...
========

Will the mean value (for delay 0.01) be used for curve fitting and rate
extraction ?
Or will both values at delay 0.01 be used during curve fitting, hence
giving more weight on delay 0.01 ?

In other words, will the fit only use both values at delay 0.01 for
error estimation or also for rate extraction, giving more weight for
this duplicate point ?

How is this handled in relax ?

Instinctively, I would guess that the man value must be used for
fitting, as we don't want the points that are not in duplicate to count
less in the fitting procedure... Am I right ?

</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

I would argue not. If we have gone to the trouble of measuring
something twice (or, equivalently, measuring it with greater
precision) then we should weight it more strongly to reflect that.

So we should include both duplicate points in our fit, or we should
just use the mean value, but weight it to reflect the greater
certainty we have in its value.

As I type this I realise this is likely the source of the sqrt(2)
factor Tyler and Edward have been debating on a parallel thread - the
uncertainty in height of any one peak is equal to the RMS noise, but
the std error of the mean of duplicates is less by a factor of
sqrt(2).
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

At the moment, relax simply uses the mean value in the fit.  Despite
the higher quality of the duplicated data, all points are given the
same weight.  This is only because of the low data quantity.  As for
dividing the sd of differences between duplicate spectra by sqrt(2),
this is not done in relax anymore.  Because some people have collected
triplicate spectra, although rare, relax calculates the error from
replicated spectra differently.  I'm prepared to be told that this
technique is incorrect though.  The procedure relax uses is to apply
the formula:

sd^2 = sum({Ii - Iav}^2) / (n - 1),

where n is the number of spectra, Ii is the intensity in spectrum i,
Iav is the average intensity, sd is the standard deviation, and sd^2
is the variance.  This is for a single spin.  The sample number is so
low that this value is completely meaningless.  Therefore the variance
is averaged across all spins (well due to a current bug the standard
deviation is averaged instead).  Then another averaging takes place if
not all spectra are duplicated.  The variances across all duplicated
spectra are averaged to give a single error value for all spins across
all spectra (again the sd averaging bug affects this).  The reason for
using this approach is that you are not limited to duplicate spectra.
It also means that the factor of sqrt(2) is not applicable.  If only
single spectra are collected, then relax's current behaviour of not
using sqrt(2) seems reasonable.

</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Here is how I understand the sqrt(2) issue:

The sd of duplicate (or triplicate, or quadruplicate, or ... ) peak
heights is assumed to give a good estimate of the precision with which
we can measure the height of a single peak. So for peak heights that
have not been measured in duplicate (ie relaxation times that have not
been duplicated in our current set of spectra), sd is a good estimate
of the uncertainty associated with that height.

For peaks we have measured more than once, we can calculate a mean
peak height. The precision with which we know that mean value is given
by the std error of the mean ie. sd/sqrt(n) where n is the number of
times we have measured that specific relaxation time. I think this is
the origin of the sqrt(2) for duplicate data.

A made up example:
T           I
0          1.00
10        0.90
10        0.86
20        0.80
40        0.75
70        0.72
70        0.68
100      0.55
150      0.40
200      0.30

The std deviation of our duplicates is 0.04 so the uncertainty on each
value above is 0.04

BUT, the uncertainty on the mean values for our duplicate time points
(10 and 70) is 0.04/sqrt(2) = 0.028

So if we use the mean values as points in our fit, we should use 0.028
as the uncertainty on those values (while all other peaks have
uncertainty 0.04)

Alternatively (and equivalently) we can use the original observations,
including all duplicate points. In this case, all points have the same
uncertainty of 0.04, as they are all the result of a single
measurement.

To do anything else is to underestimate the precision with which we
have measured our relaxation rates.

Chris

P.S.  The idea for the 1.3 line is to create a new class of user
functions, 'spectrum.read_intensities()', 'spectrum.set_rmsd()',
'spectrum.error_analysis()', etc. to make all of this independent of
the analysis type.  See

<pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi Troels,

For part 4), the wiki graphic has now been changed.

Cheers,

I am happy, that you think it is a good idea.

1) Porting/safety download of the wiki
There will be two things you need to safety download.
From the FTP and the MYSQL database.

The FTP contains the LocalSettings.php, which provide the settings for the
wiki
and the extensions (<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Extensions">http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Extensions</a>).
The FTP also contain the images that is uploaded to the wiki.

The wiki entries are written to a MYSQL database, which is the important one
to
backup.

For safety reasons, I suggest a model where you get the passwords to the FTP
and the
MYSQL database. If you then can make a backup script that on a weekly/daily
basis
make a dump of the FTP and the MYSQL database, and make that available
external,
I think that is the best model. I would be insecure about sharing the
passwords for other
than trusted people.

2) Setting up: wiki.nmr-relax.com
I see that it is working, but there is a DNS problem, which prevent user
creation,
log in/out and editing.
According to my brother you need to tweak your DNS provider. You have
GoDaddy and DNS via domaincontrol.com. You should set up a CNAME
record and point to IP 217.116.232.203.
Let's take this off-list.

3) Scripts for the wiki
I was part of migrating all the scripts at the pymolwiki into a shared
pymol-script-repo
at Github. The advantages are many. Read here for reference.
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Git">http://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Git</a>
I wrote all these entries at the pymol wiki.
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Git_install">http://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Git_install</a>
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Git_authors">http://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Git_authors</a>
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Git_script_guidelines">http://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Git_script_guidelines</a>
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Git_admin">http://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Git_admin</a>

For the wiki, Thomas Holder made a &quot;wiki box&quot;. (A dynamic page thing)
One just write in the wiki entry:
{{Infobox script-repo
|type      = script
|filename  = propka.py
|author    = [[User:Tlinnet|Troels E. Linnet]]
|license   = BSD
}}

You can for example see it here:
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Propka">http://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Propka</a>

If one in the top-right click 'propka.py', you are
redirected to the &quot;raw&quot; view at github.
There is color and raw view available
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/Pymol-Scripts/Pymol-script-repo/blob/master/propka.py">https://github.com/Pymol-Scripts/Pymol-script-repo/blob/master/propka.py</a>
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://raw.github.com/Pymol-Scripts/Pymol-script-repo/master/propka.py">https://raw.github.com/Pymol-Scripts/Pymol-script-repo/master/propka.py</a>

I suggest we setup up a similar system.
Creating an &quot;organisation&quot; at at gihub, for the merged scripts.
Developers can then fork, modify, and make a &quot;pull request&quot; from their
repo to the organisation repo.
Note, that the traffic is &quot;quite&quot; low.

But one could make tutorials, analysing scripts, matplot lib plotting.
Etc etc.
The good thing with this, is that this will provide a &quot;fast track&quot;
development for
users. Making it more &quot;fun&quot; for new NMR people, with script background.
Users do not need to &quot;care&quot; to much about backwards compatibility.
If the wiki pages have a large hit-rate, the functionality could then be
considered
to be official implemented in the relax source code.

4) Graphic icon
Sure ! I already stole one icon from the repo. Can you point out which one?
With the FTP access, you can also do it ourself. :-)
Upload it to: /skins/common/images
And modify LocalSettings.php at the entry:
$wgLogo             = &quot;$wgStylePath/common/images/ulysses.png&quot;;

5) Name: relax
I have modified the name, and will try to remember forwards.
Note, that you can create a user, and do it your self. :-)
I suggest you create two users.
I will grant one admin rights, and in the daily, I suggest logging
in with the &quot;plain&quot; user, to prevent accidentally clicking one of the
&quot;power&quot; buttons.

6) Organisation.
You can change the title/pages/categories, as you find fit. :-)
As for organisation of pages/categories, I agree that we should have that in
mind.
But before we/I use to much energy, I think we should wait a &quot;little&quot; to let
the information
grow. Then we can take a &quot;cleaning/organisation&quot; round.
I for example, will only cover material/tutorials/install instructions that
is directly usable for
&quot;our&quot; group, which is dynamics in us time scale. I &quot;hope&quot; that groups which
will benefit
for detailed instructions on their type of analysis, will provide the
entries needed.

7) License

$wgRightsPage = &quot;&quot;; # Set to the title of a wiki page that describes your

Hi Troels,

This is a really good idea!  I would have started this a long time ago
but, because the Gna! infrastructure does not support PHP, a wiki was
never possible.  It would be possible to set this up but for an open
source project we will have to first make the wiki migratable.
Therefore I would suggest first writing a script to be added to the
devel_scripts directory which will make a mirror copy of the backend
of the wiki.  That way a subset of the relax developers could set up a
cronjob with this script, just as is down with the relax subversion
repository and the relax mailing lists (see the backup_repository and
backup_mailing_lists scripts).  This backup would need to be
sufficient to set up the wiki on another server.  This is simply part
of the strategy for having all parts of relax survive forever,
independent of who comes and goes from the project (including myself).

The URL <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/">http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/</a> is a good idea.  I have paid for
the <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nmr-relax.com/">http://www.nmr-relax.com/</a> domain name myself, through Godaddy, and
I am able to set up this subdomain.  I will set this up for testing
but to be permanent the backup script for easy migration will be
needed.  Ok, it is now activated.

I also have a few suggestions/questions for the wiki design:

- I was wondering if you thought it would be possible for users to
upload scripts to such a wiki?  If so, how would this be implemented?

- You can use one of the relax icons with a transparent background
from the graphics/ directory rather than the current one with a white
background.

- The project is called simply 'relax' and not 'NMR relax'.  The
reason I had to use <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nmr-relax.com">http://www.nmr-relax.com</a> is that the relax.com
domain name was not available.  I have used it in a few other places,
again because the name 'relax' was not available (for example at
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/nmr-relax">https://www.ohloh.net/p/nmr-relax</a> and
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://freecode.com/projects/nmr-relax">http://freecode.com/projects/nmr-relax</a>).

- The title will need modification as relax supports almost all NMR
dynamics analysis types.  Relaxation dispersion is only a small subset
of what relax can do.  Therefore it might be good to have an
organisation around the different analysis types.

- We should discuss the licence for the content.  Would it be possible
to use the same licence as the relax website
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nmr-relax.com/fdl.html">http://www.nmr-relax.com/fdl.html</a>)?

Cheers,

Edward

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Dear relax developers.

I felt the need to create a wiki, to document my own progress into the
relax
use.

Much in the same way the pymol wiki serves an excellent resource of
information.

I was noting information down in our internal lab wiki about relax, but
found it more useful if more
users could take advantage of this information.

At the moment, it is located at my brothers domain:
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://nmr-relax.kimlinnet.dk">http://nmr-relax.kimlinnet.dk</a>

I hope when it has matured, and after a little discussion of format, it
can
be moved to:
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wiki.nmr-relax.com/">http://www.wiki.nmr-relax.com/</a>

My most strong motivation, was that I last year made a tutorial at the
pymol
wiki, for
a course in biochemistry. Returning the following year with teaching in
the
same course,
I noticed over 8000 views. Not bad.

I see a wiki as an excellent possibility for &quot;quickly&quot; noting and
improving
information, which is
not readily available in the manual or other &quot;places&quot;

I try to make links to the relax online manual and API, and then
improving
with contents I myself
would find useful, or that I find answers to.

If some pages has a large &quot;hit-rate&quot; it could be considered valuable to
&quot;rewrite / port&quot; the information into
the relax manual? And with the text &quot;kind-of&quot; available, it should not
take
to long time to &quot;copy/paste/modify&quot; it.

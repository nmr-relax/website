  Addition of the molecule-residue-spin data classes.
  
  The following classes have been created:
      MoleculeList
      MoleculeContainer
      ResidueList
      ResidueContainer
      SpinList
      SpinContainer
  
  These were modified from the original Residue and ResidueList classes.

lines
  
  incorrect interpretation of test_module corrected, unit tests work from
  relax command line again
........
  r3129 | bugman | 2007-03-09 17:25:17 +1100 (Fri, 09 Mar 2007) | 3 lines
  
  Deleted the unused Data.__init__() method.
........
  r3130 | bugman | 2007-03-09 18:46:41 +1100 (Fri, 09 Mar 2007) | 6 lines
  
  Converted the residue specific data container into the molecule list 'mol' 
in the pipe container.
  
  The old residue specific container was located at 'self.relax.data.res' 
whereas the molecule list
  object is located at D[pipe].mol where D is the relax data storage 
singleton.
........
  r3131 | bugman | 2007-03-09 19:00:51 +1100 (Fri, 09 Mar 2007) | 7 lines
  
  Bug fix.
  
  The __repr__ method of the PipeContainer was failing because of the call to 
getattr() for the 'mol'
  object.  Now the 'mol', 'diff', and 'structure' objects are not sent to 
getattr(), rather a special
  description is given rather than the object's attribute.
........
  r3132 | bugman | 2007-03-09 19:02:25 +1100 (Fri, 09 Mar 2007) | 3 lines

  Added the variable name = None to the MoleculeContainer class namespace.
  
  This variable is the name of the molecule, which if specified should 
correspond to a molecule or
  chain identifier in the 3D structure file.
........
  r3135 | bugman | 2007-03-09 19:12:42 +1100 (Fri, 09 Mar 2007) | 3 lines

MoleculeContainer class.
........
  r3138 | bugman | 2007-03-09 20:29:42 +1100 (Fri, 09 Mar 2007) | 5 lines

string.
........
  r3141 | bugman | 2007-03-10 10:42:21 +1100 (Sat, 10 Mar 2007) | 12 lines
  
  Completion of the core of the molecule-residue-spin data structures.
  
  All of the initialisation of the class variables and objects in all six 
classes have been shifted
  into __init__() methods so that new copies of the objects are created when 
molecules, residues, or
  spins are added to the structure.
  
  The __repr__() methods of all classes have been updated and return a proper 
text representation of
  the objects.
  
  The XList class docstrings have been updated.
........
  r3142 | bugman | 2007-03-10 11:08:41 +1100 (Sat, 10 Mar 2007) | 3 lines

  Renamed 'run' to 'pipe' in the 'run' user function class.
  
  The file 'prompt/run.py' was renamed to 'prompt/pipe.py' and all instances 
of 'run' renamed to
  'pipe'.  The placing of the user function class into the interpreter 
namespace was also updated.
  The docstrings of all the user functions where modified to use the new 
terminology.
........
  r3144 | bugman | 2007-03-10 12:04:14 +1100 (Sat, 10 Mar 2007) | 6 lines
  
  Renamed 'run' to 'pipe' in the 'generic_fns.runs' module.
  
  The file 'generic_fns/run.py' was renamed to 'generic_fns/pipe.py' and all 
instances of 'run'
  renamed to 'pipe'.
........
  r3145 | bugman | 2007-03-10 12:05:17 +1100 (Sat, 10 Mar 2007) | 3 lines
  
  Updated the data model redesign document to say that point 8 of the 
preparation is complete.

........
  r3148 | bugman | 2007-03-10 12:28:28 +1100 (Sat, 10 Mar 2007) | 13 lines
  
  Removed the ability for stand alone execution of the diffusion tensor data 
structure unit tests.
  
  Stand alone execution is unnecessary as the command:
  
  $ ./unit_test_runner.py data/test_diff_tensor.py
  
  will run the tests.
  
  Three things have been changed.  Firstly the system path modifications have 
been removed.  Secondly
  the 'if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:' block has been deleted.  Finally the 
'svn:executable' property has
  been removed from the repository.
........
  r3149 | bugman | 2007-03-10 12:29:29 +1100 (Sat, 10 Mar 2007) | 3 lines

........
  r3151 | bugman | 2007-03-10 13:03:28 +1100 (Sat, 10 Mar 2007) | 3 lines
  
  Updated the docstring of 'generic_fns.pipes.create' to be in Epydoc format.

'data.mol_res_spin'.
........
  r3154 | bugman | 2007-03-13 14:32:48 +1100 (Tue, 13 Mar 2007) | 4 lines
  
  Bug fix.
  
  The import statement for the pipes module has been removed from 
'generic_fns.main'.
........
  r3155 | bugman | 2007-03-13 14:34:03 +1100 (Tue, 13 Mar 2007) | 7 lines
  
  Fixed the problems with the classes of the 'data.mol_res_spin' module.
  
  The add_item() methods of the list type classes have been modified.  For 
the MoleculeList class the
  'mol_name' argument has been added and the MoleculeContainer.__init__() 
method accepts this argument
  as well.  The 'res_name', 'res_num', 'spin_name', 'spin_num', and 'select' 
have similarily been
  added.
........
  r3156 | bugman | 2007-03-13 14:34:49 +1100 (Tue, 13 Mar 2007) | 2 lines
  
  Added unit tests for the relax data storage singleton class Data from the 
'data' module. 
........
  r3157 | bugman | 2007-03-13 14:36:45 +1100 (Tue, 13 Mar 2007) | 9 lines
  
  Fixed the function generic_fns.pipes.create().
  
  The relax data store singleton method 'add()' has been deleted as the 
method required the first
  argument to be the singleton instance.  Instead the functionality has been 
shifted into the
  generic_fns.pipes.create() function.  The unit tests have been modified for 
the new setup.
  
  All references to 'run' in the file 
'test_suite/unit_tests/generic_fns/test_pipes.py' have been
  replaced with 'pipe'.
........
  r3158 | bugman | 2007-03-13 14:37:42 +1100 (Tue, 13 Mar 2007) | 5 lines
  
  Added a tearDown() method to the 
'test_suite/unit_tests/generic_fns/test_pipes.py' file.
  
  The relax data storage object is reset as the data added to it from 
different tests was clashing.
  The method allows the 'test_creation_fail' unit test to pass.
........
  r3159 | bugman | 2007-03-13 14:38:11 +1100 (Tue, 13 Mar 2007) | 2 lines
  
  Rewrote the 'generic_fns.pipes.delete()' function.
........
  r3160 | bugman | 2007-03-13 14:38:54 +1100 (Tue, 13 Mar 2007) | 4 lines
  
  Fixed the 'test_deletion_fail()' unit test.
  
  The error throw was RelaxNoRunError and not RelaxError.
........
  r3161 | bugman | 2007-03-13 14:40:20 +1100 (Tue, 13 Mar 2007) | 5 lines
  
  Fixed the setting of the current data pipe so that the 'test_creation()' 
unit test passes.
  
  The current data pipe was not being set to the new data pipe created by the 
function
  'generic_fns.pipes.create()'.
........
  r3162 | bugman | 2007-03-13 14:41:19 +1100 (Tue, 13 Mar 2007) | 5 lines
  
  Fixed the setting of the current data pipe so that the 'test_deletion()' 
unit test passes.
  
  The current data pipe was not being set to None by the 
'generic_fns.pipes.delete()' if the deleted
  pipe is the current pipe.
........
  r3163 | bugman | 2007-03-13 14:41:54 +1100 (Tue, 13 Mar 2007) | 5 lines
  
  Removed the functions not used by relax from the 'generic_fns.pipes' 
module. 
  
  The functions 'eliminate_unused_pipes()' and 'list_of_pipes()' have been 
deleted as they are not
  used anywhere within relax.  The unit test for the 
'eliminate_unused_pipes()' has also been deleted.
........
  r3164 | bugman | 2007-03-13 14:43:51 +1100 (Tue, 13 Mar 2007) | 6 lines
  
  The pipe.create() user function now works!
  
  The prompt.pipe module now import the 'generic_fns.pipes' module and 
executes the create() function.
  The system/functional test for this user function now passes and has been 
updated with runs renamed
  to pipes.
........
  r3165 | bugman | 2007-03-13 14:45:17 +1100 (Tue, 13 Mar 2007) | 2 lines
  
  Created the new pipe.current() user function.
........
  r3166 | bugman | 2007-03-13 14:45:47 +1100 (Tue, 13 Mar 2007) | 4 lines
  
  Created the pipe.switch() user function for switching between data pipes.
  
  Two unit tests were created for the new code - test_switch() and 
test_switch_fail().
........
  r3167 | bugman | 2007-03-13 14:46:31 +1100 (Tue, 13 Mar 2007) | 2 lines
  
  Created the pipe.list() user function for printing a list of all the data 
pipes.
........
  r3168 | bugman | 2007-03-13 14:47:39 +1100 (Tue, 13 Mar 2007) | 5 lines
  
  Created a prototype design pattern as a base class with the __copy__() 
method.
  
  The prototype __copy__() method simply returns a deepcopy of the object.  
The PipeContainer,
  SpinContainer, ResidueContainer, and MoleculeContainer classes now inherit 
from the prototype class.
........
  r3169 | bugman | 2007-03-13 14:48:03 +1100 (Tue, 13 Mar 2007) | 2 lines
  
  Updated and fixed the 'pipe.delete()' user function.
........
  r3170 | bugman | 2007-03-13 14:48:29 +1100 (Tue, 13 Mar 2007) | 5 lines
  
  Implemented the 'pipe.copy()' user function.
  
  The 'generic_fns.pipes.copy()' function and the three unit tests 
'test_copy', 'test_copy_current',
  'test_copy_fail' have been added.
........
  r3171 | bugman | 2007-03-13 18:49:52 +1100 (Tue, 13 Mar 2007) | 12 lines
  
  Bug fix for the prototype copying.
  
  These changes cause the 'test_copy' and 'test_copy_current' unit tests of 
'test_pipe.py' to pass.
  
  The prototype '__copy__()' method has been renamed to '__clone__()' as 
'__copy__()' is reserved as a
  replacement method for the 'copy' method of the 'copy' module.  As the 
'deepcopy' method was not
  copying all of the objects of the pipe container correctly, the 
'__deepcopy__() replacement method
  has been added to the prototype base class.
  
  All subclassing of 'ListType' and 'DictType' have been replaced by 'list' 
and 'dict'.

<pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi Manish,

Welcome to the relax mailing lists!  I'm guessing from your email
address that you are from Murray Coles' group
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.eb.tuebingen.mpg.de/research/departments/protein-evolution/murray-coles.html">http://www.eb.tuebingen.mpg.de/research/departments/protein-evolution/murray-coles.html</a>)
in Tuebingen ;)  I should be able to help with the problems you see.
</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">From the messages, I can see that there are two distinct issues.  The
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">simplest is the error message you encountered.  This is a bug in relax
which I have just fixed, see:

<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.scm/16578">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.scm/16578</a>

At this point, relax was trying to tell you that something is wrong
with your input relaxation data.  The message should have told you
that a relaxation data error of zero has been encountered and that
this is fatal for a model-free analysis (or for that matter any type
of data analysis).  I was wondering how you calculated your R1, R2,
and NOE relaxation data?  Did you use relax to calculate these?  Did
you use the gold standard Monte Carlo simulations for propagating peak
height errors to relaxation data errors?  On another unrelated note,
it might be worth reading the message I just sent to Angelo Miguel
Figueiredo about relaxation data collection and testing on this
mailing list (see the archive at
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.user/1419/focus=1423">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.user/1419/focus=1423</a>).

The second problem is indicated by the messages about the absence of
relaxation mechanisms.  This says that either the magnetic
dipole-dipole interaction or the CSA interaction has not been set up.
Did you follow, step-by-step, the instructions in the highly detailed
tutorial in the relax manual?  For example in the web version of the
manual at <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/new_protocol_in_GUI.html">http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/new_protocol_in_GUI.html</a>.
Specifically this section on setting up the relaxation mechanisms:

<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/d_Auvergne_protocol_GUI_mode_relaxation_interactio.html">http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/d_Auvergne_protocol_GUI_mode_relaxation_interactio.html</a>

It could be that you missed one of the steps required to set up these
interactions.  If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate
to ask.  I hope this information helped.

Regards,

Edward

Subject: Model Free Analysis problem
Hello,

I have just spent some time trying to get relax2.2.3 working. I've a good 
set of data (R1,R2, NOE) at 600 and 800 MHz. Although it seems the data is 
imported OK, the model free runs do no work, in that there are no model 
assignments.

I'm not able to execute relax and am getting the following error:

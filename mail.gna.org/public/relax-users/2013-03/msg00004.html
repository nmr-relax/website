<pre style="margin: 0em;">Hello,

I have just spent some time trying to get relax2.2.3 working. I've a good set 
of data (R1,R2, NOE) at 600 and 800 MHz. Although it seems the data is 
imported OK, the model free runs do no work, in that there are no model 
assignments.

I'm not able to execute relax and am getting the following error:

         * All system and GUI tests reliant on the relax-fit C modules are 
deactivated if import fails.  This removes a pile of useless error messages 
from the test suite and presents a table of skipped tests at the end.
         * More Python 3 fixes for the use of now non-existent string module 
functions.
         * Python 3 fix for the model-free BMRB export - many string module 
methods no longer exist.
-        * Mass conversion of the alignment tensor data structures to the 
same new design as the diffusion tensor.  This large set of changes matches 
all of those revisions for the diffusion tensor already committed.  The 
alignment tensor data structures are now read only, and can only be modified 
via the set() method.  This is a much simplified design which works on all 
Python versions.  
-        * Small clean ups of the diffusion tensor data structure code.  
-        * Deleted the now unused _update_sim_set() method of the diffusion 
tensor data structure.  
-        * Removed the now unused _update_sim_append() method from the 
diffusion tensor data structure.  
-        * Cleaned up the docstring of the diffusion tensor data object 
__setattr__() method.  
-        * Updated all of the diffusion tensor unit tests to the new design.  
-        * Fix for the reading of model-free results files from relax 1.2 
when simulation data is missing.  
-        * Fix for the reading of relax 1.2 model-free results files for the 
diffusion tensor structure redesign.  
-        * Another fix for the fold_angles() diffusion tensor function - 
again an incomplete design conversion.  
-        * Fix for the setting of the diffusion tensor parameter errors in 
the model-free specific analysis code.  
-        * Fix for the setup of the model-free Monte Carlo simulations for 
the new diffusion tensor design.  
-        * Another fix for the diffusion_tensor.init user function - it was 
not completely converted.  
-        * Fix for the fixing of parameters in the model-free analyses.  The 
diffusion tensor set_fixed() method is now used.  
-        * Fix for the XML output of the diffusion tensor - only the 
modifiable parameters are output.  This was the previous behaviour and is 
needed for the test suite to pass.  
-        * Converted the palmer.extract user function to use the new 
diffusion tensor design.  
-        * The diffusion tensor bmrb_read() function now uses the set_fixed() 
method instead of fixed().  
-        * The fix user function now uses the diffusion tensor set_fixed() 
method.  
-        * Renamed the diffusion tensor fixed() method to set_fixed() to 
avoid clashing with the 'fixed' object.  
-        * Fix for the model-free specific analysis duplicate_data() method 
for the new design.  The diffusion tensor __mod_attr__ object is now called 
_mod_attr.  
-        * Fix for the diffusion tensor to_xml() method for the new design.  
For some reason the methods of the Element class are no longer blacklisted.  
-        * Converted the diffusion tensor data structure from_xml() method to 
the new tensor design.  
-        * Fix for the Diffusion_tensor.test_copy system test - the 
simulation parameters are now read-only.  Instead, the diffusion tensor set() 
method needs to be called.  
-        * The setting of list values for the DiffTensorSimList object now 
works correctly.  The private _set() method now works correctly by calling 
the base class method, and the normal setting of diffusion tensor simulation 
values produces a RelaxError.  
-        * Fix for the diffusion tensor __deepcopy__() replacement method for 
the new design.  
-        * The model-free specific analysis _disassemble_param_vector() 
method now uses the new diffusion tensor design.  
-        * Modified the setUp() method for the diffusion tensor system tests 
to use the new design.  
-        * Redesigned how diffusion tensor simulation structures are handled. 
 The design is now much cleaner and works with all Python versions.  
-        * Removed all the unused imports from specific_fns.model_free.main.  
-        * A number of private diffusion tensor objects and methods have 
switched to the single leading '_' format.  
-        * Improvements to the diffusion tensor set() method.  The 
parameters, errors and simulations are now properly differentiated and 
stored.  
-        * Converted the old diffusion tensor __setattr__() method into the 
set() method.  This is the only way in which diffusion tensor parameters, 
errors and simulations can be set.  
-        * Renamed the diffusion tensor data structure type() method to 
set_type().  This is because the type is stored as the 'type' object, 
clashing with the method name.  
-        * Created the diffusion tensor data structure type() method for 
setting the tensor type.  This is to remove the &quot;cdp.diff_tensor.type = 'x'&quot; 
code from the core of relax, as the structure is now read only.  
-        * The new diffusion tensor fixed() method has been created to allow 
the fixed flag to be changed.  
-        * Fix for the initialisation of the diffusion tensor data structure, 
now that it is read-only.  
-        * The diffusion tensor data structure has been completely converted 
into a read-only structure.  The __setattr__() method now will always raise a 
RelaxError, and the diffusion tensor simulation data structure objects 
__setitem__() method will raise the same error.

into a read-only structure.  The __setattr__() method now will always raise a 
RelaxError, and the diffusion tensor simulation data structure objects 
__setitem__() method will raise the same error.
         * Updated the relax version numbers and 'trunk' used relax user 
manual.  For example the information about checking out the main development 
line was still talking about 1.3 rather than the trunk.
         * Python 3 fix for the setting of diffusion and alignment tensor 
simulation values.  The previous code somehow worked in Python 2 but was not 
formally correct and broke in Python 3.
         * Python 3 fix for the model-free results file reading tests.  The 
ordering of dictionaries is different in Python 3, so now these are properly 
converted from strings to dictionaries before comparison.  This was not 
happening because of the XML changes from Python 2.7.3 onwards.

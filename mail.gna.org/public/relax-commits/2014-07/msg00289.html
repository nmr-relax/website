  Moved the calculation of pA and kex out off all loopes.
  
  This was done by having two special 1/0 spin structure arrays.

  Very important fix, for only replacing part of data array which have Nan 
values.
  
  Before, all values were replaced, which was wrong.

  Needed to increase the relative tolerance when testing if pA array is 1.
  
  Now system test Relax_disp.test_hansen_cpmg_data_missing_auto_analysis 
passes.
  
  Also added some comments lines, to prepare for mask replace of values.
  For example if only some of etapos values should be replaced.

  Implemented a masked array search for where &quot;missing&quot; array is equal 1.
  
  This makes it possible to replace all values with this mask, from the value 
array.
  
  This eliminates the last loops over the missing values.
  
  It took over 4 hours to figure out, that the mask should be called with 
mask.mask,
  to return the same fulls structure,

  Important fix for replacing values if eta_pos &gt; 700 is violated.
  
  This fixes systemtest: Relax_disp.test_sod1wt_t25_to_cr72, which failed 
after making kex to a numpy float.
  
  The trick is to make a numpy mask which stores the position where to 
replace the values.
  Then replace the values just before last return.
  
  This makes sure, that not all values are changed.

  Started using the new way of constructing dw.
  
  This is for running system tests.
  
  Note, somewhere in the dw array, the frequencies will be different between 
the two implementations.
  But apparently, this does not matter.

  Implemented the fastest way to calculate the dw structure.
  
  This uses the numpy ufunc multiply.outer function to create the outer 
array, and then multiply
  with the frqs_structure.

  This is very strange, but otherwise system test:
  Relax_disp.test_hansen_cpmg_data_missing_auto_analysis

  It is MUCH faster to just subtract and check sum is not 0.0.

  Replaced the multiplcation with the disp structure, to a replacement with a 
mask.
  
  My timings are varying at my computer, so results are within the very same 
timing.
  
  But for reading the code, having two masks, is essential better.

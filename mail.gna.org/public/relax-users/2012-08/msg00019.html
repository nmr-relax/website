<pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi,

Here is another version of the relax manual
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://download.gna.org/relax/manual/relax_17370.pdf">http://download.gna.org/relax/manual/relax_17370.pdf</a>).  I have added
a new chapter called 'The relax data model'.  There have been other
improvements throughout the manual as well (an addition of a new
chapter dedicated to how to cite the various parts of relax, expanded
abbreviations, and hyperlinks in the bibliography), but this chapter
should significantly help in understanding how to start with relax in
both the GUI and prompt/scripting UI modes.  Any feedback and
suggestions for improving the manual would be most welcome.

Cheers,

Edward

I've actually found an easier way to obtain copies of the relax manual
as I make changes.  I've uploaded the file to
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://download.gna.org/relax/manual/">http://download.gna.org/relax/manual/</a>.  The most recent copy is
relax_17348.pdf (the number is the repository revision number the
manual was created from).  Thank you for the suggestions.

Cheers,

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi Nick,

The problem appears to be in the intensity files with the RelaxWarnings:

RelaxWarning: The sequence data in the line ['R1', '0.9262', '0.0013']
is invalid, the residue number data '0.9262' is invalid.

This tells me that the file contains a column with the 1 letter
residue code fused with the residue number.  If so, how are TRP indole
nitrogens handled?  Which software created this format?  The
spectrum.read_intensities user function is expecting a peak list from
Sparky, XEasy, NMRView, or a generic columnar formatted peak list, but
instead the relaxation rates are being fed in, causing relax to not
know what to do.  I would guess that an R1 or R2 analysis has been
initialised, and the relaxation rates rather than spectral peak lists
are being fed in.

For the formatting of the rates, this should match the loaded spins
which in this case comes from the PDB file.  Therefore the line:

R1 0.9262 0.0013

should be changed to:

ARG 1 0.9262 0.0013

The residue name and number columns can then be specified.  If you
have indole data, then an extra column can be given for the spin name
again matching the PDB naming (I would highly recommend using this
additional data).

I have modified the relaxation curve-fitting chapter of the relax
manual and now give examples of the format for Sparky, XEasy, and
NMRView peak list files.  This will only be available in the next
released version of relax.  The changes can be obtained using the
subversion program if you cannot wait but, as this is in the manual,
the PDF version would need to be hand compiled (requiring the
installation of LaTeX, scons, and dvips).

As for attaching files, it is best not to do this for mailing list
messages.  The reason is because the messages are massively amplified
and sent to the many people subscribed to the mailing lists.  This
puts a large strain on the open source infrastructure of Gna!
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/">https://gna.org/</a>).  Note that this is a public mailing list and
messages are archived permanently all over the web:

<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://news.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.user">http://news.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.user</a>
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mail-archive.com/relax-users@xxxxxxx/">http://www.mail-archive.com/relax-users@xxxxxxx/</a>
<a  rel="nofollow" href="/mail.gna.org/public/relax-users/2012-08/threads.html">https://mail.gna.org/public/relax-users/2012-08/threads.html</a>

If large files need to be transmitted, then the relax tracker
infrastructure can be used.  Either a bug report
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/bugs/?group=relax">https://gna.org/bugs/?group=relax</a>), a support request
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/support/index.php?group=relax">https://gna.org/support/index.php?group=relax</a>) or a task
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/task/index.php?group=relax">https://gna.org/task/index.php?group=relax</a>) can be created and the
files attached there.

Thanks for the info. My student Donald and I are tinkering both with the
teminal version of relax and the GUI (running on Ubuntu 12.04), but 
ideally
we'd like to make the GUI work seamlessly. Please find below the first 
error
message we get when trying to run a simple R1 fit using the relax GUI. 
Files
are also attached.

I've run ModelFree analyses with SÃ©bastien in the distant past but this is
our first time running relax in my lab. I'll try to provide any 
information
worth mentioning from the perspective of a beginner with the interface. So
far we've been a bit disappointed by the level of step-by-step 
explanations
you'd expect to find in the manual. Python users know how to run python
scripts, but this is really harsh for someone like Donald with no
programming experience whatsoever.

I believe this could be overcome by providing a simple example with all 
the
required files (r1, r2 and noe lists in the right format, scripts, pdb,
etc.). That way we could make sure our Sparky lists are edited exactly how
they need to be for relax, in addition to allowing the right column number
selection in the GUI options. I believe this might be our problem in the
present case.

Thanks for your input.

Nick Doucet

Below is the error message I get. I've tried multiple text formats of this
data (two of them are listed below), but the application doesn't seem to
recognize the residue number with the one in the PDB. I've changed the
column numbers (mol_name_col=?, res_num_col=?, res_name_col=?, etc.) and
tried different combinations but again, without success.

Hi,

Welcome to the relax mailing lists - well, accidentally anyway :)  As
Sebastien said, please feel free to ask here if you have any
difficulties or problems - I should be able to help you sort out most
issues.  And all user feedback is most welcome!  relax is now such a
massive multi-developer project that I am unable to keep everything
perfectly up to date, so any suggestions are taken seriously.

For the fitting of the relaxation rates, I would strongly recommend
relax over the Sparky fitting.  The reason is because I'm pretty sure
that Sparky does not use the gold standard for error propagation -
Monte Carlo simulations.  Hence your error estimates may not be
accurate and this has a strong effect on the model-free analysis.
Other programs, such as relax and Art Palmer's curvefit, perform the
error propagation properly.

As for understanding the analysis, the analysis chapters of the relax
manual together with the user function documentation should hopefully
provide enough details.  I have just noticed that the relaxation
curve-fitting chapter is very much out of date!  If you use the GUI, I
have redesigned it so that usage should be very obvious and not
require any reading of the manual or user function documentation.
Again, if anything is not 100% obvious, any suggestions for how to
improve this are welcome.

Unfortunately there is no full test data set to try the analyses on.
This is something I plan on adding to relax in the future once I
publish a paper from my PhD times.  Note though that, although a
single model-free calculation is extremely quick within all software
packages, the full highly-iterative model-free analysis protocol can
take between 1 to 2 weeks to complete.  relax implements this full
protocol into the GUI (details are available via the 'about' button in
the model-free analysis tab) or in the
sample_scripts/model_free/dauvergne_protocol.py script.  As this takes
such a long time, I'm not sure how useful such an example data set
would be.  You can always speed the analysis up by using Gary
Thompson's multi-processor code within relax - see the introductory
chapter for how to use this.

Regards,

Edward


P. S.  You can implement one of the original model-free analysis
protocols from the 1990's if you can only collect single field
strength data.  relax is so flexible that it is capable of reproducing
the results from Modelfree4 and Dasha extremely accurately, you just
need turn the optimisation precision to very low values.  However to
be sure that the internal dynamics is real and not due to a slightly
incorrect estimate of the diffusion tensor, data at two field
strengths (with both temperature compensation and per-experiment
temperature calibration) is highly recommended.

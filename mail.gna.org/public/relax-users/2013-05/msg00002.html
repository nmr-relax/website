<pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi Nav,

I wouldn't worry about this.  I don't think there is a single person
in history who has collected perfect relaxation data the first time.
If someone says they have, I definitely would not believe them!  Just
make sure you handle both temperature compensation (single-scan
interleaving and temperature compensation blocks) and temperature
control (checking every experiment on every spectrometer with
MeOH/Ethylene glycol).  Unfortunately the paper from the Gooley lab
describing this is not published yet.  But all the details are
described in the relax manual, so maybe the relax papers might be a
possible citation ;)

Regards,

Edward

Hi Nav,

Martin is spot on here.  The temperature control and temperature
calibration has been a topic much discussed on the relax mailing
lists.  For example, here are some threads where you can find out more
information, if you wish:

continuation of the previous thread)

You need to click on all the messages in the thread to follow them.
There are many more threads on this area, but I don't have the time to
find them all right now.  The following message might be of
significant help for you:

<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.user/1419/focus=1423">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.user/1419/focus=1423</a>

Firstly note that if you have a temperature problem, this will not be
solved by looking at a single field strength as it is a problem
between experiments on the same spectrometer.  So even if you perform
an analysis with data from a single field strength, the R1 data might
be up to 2 degrees warmer or colder than the R2, and the same problem
will occur to a different degree (or direction) on the second
spectrometer.  Any analysis using such data will be meaningless, as
this will have a large effect on the diffusion tensor.  Considering
that the diffusion tensor is the major contributor to liquid state
relaxation, the internal dynamics can contribute 20% or less (see the
original model-free papers for these numbers), then any internal
dynamics will be severely distorted, possibly hidden, and artificial
motions will appear.  I would recommend you look at this section of
the relax manual for more temperature related details:

<a  rel="nofollow" href="/manual/Temperature_control_calibration.html">http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/Temperature_control_calibration.html</a>

As for relax supporting an analysis at a single field strength, there
is nothing stopping you from performing such analysis.  relax is
designed with flexibility in mind, so you can perform your model-free
analysis any way you can imagine.  With the minimisation settings, you
can replicate the exact results from Art Palmer's Modelfree, from
Dasha, or from Tensor2.  However note that I have not written any
scripts or GUI to handle this situation, as I have no interest to.  So
you would need to write the script yourself.  I would then recommend
looking at the file 'auto_analyses/dauvergne_protocol.py' to get an
idea of how to implement a full model-free protocol.  It is quite big
because of the iterative optimisation of the model-free parameters,
then model elimination, then model selection, and finally diffusion
tensor optimisation, with convergence testing.  These steps, even for
single field strength data, need to be iterated until convergence.
This can take up to 15 iterations.  You will also need to decide how
to determine your initial diffusion tensor estimate - and relax can
perform this as well.

But note that you should be aware of of the problems discovered by
Schurr et al., 1994 and Tjandra et al., 1996 of the artificial
motions.  For example see:

<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.user/326/focus=332">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.user/326/focus=332</a>

Korzhnev's review (I don't have the reference at hand) and my paper
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b702202f">http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b702202f</a>, this has the Korzhnev reference
in it) cover all of the problems you will encounter and hopefully
convince you that an analysis of single field strength data would only
be useful for perfectly isotropic systems (which is never possible due
to water shell differences around the system) which have no
significant internal motion (but note that if you see no motion with
single field strength data, that does not mean that there is no
motion).

I hope this helps,

Edward

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi Nav,

I had similar problems in the past.

The inconsistetncy has to come from somewhere. For me, it was the
temperature difference between different magnets. After I figured out 
that
we calibrated our spectrometers the wrong way, I finally got consistent
data.

Just try to superimpose two high-resolution spectra from your two
fields. They should be identical. If you can see peaks that are not 99% 
on
top of each other, I would recommend take a long hard stare at 
temperature
control.

How do you control your temperature? I found neat methanol did not work
with our spectrometers with cryoprobes, see also [1]. We use d4-methanol
now, the impurities give enough signal for a proper temperature 
calibration
(between magnets, and between experiments).

Another issue may be TROSY-based sequences, used on deuterated systems
and cryoprobes. As described by Nils Lakomek et al, that can be the 
source
for a lot of annoying artifacts. [2]

Edward will have additional ideas, I guess.

Cheers
Martin

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi Edward and other members in the group,

Just briefly mentioning my concern: I have acquired 15N-backbone
relaxation data on a protein kinase on two different fields (600 MHz 
and 800
MHz). In the beginning had some difficulties in running your scripts.
Following your suggestions, I looked through the literature and 
developed
some understanding before running all these scripts in Relax. The 
scripts
seem all working for the local_tm model. However, for sphere or the 
spheroid
models, it never converged (the run continued for several days with 
going
upto 64 rounds). On looking through the next chapter about data 
consistency,
i thought of doing consistency tests.  Tests with J0 checks, suggests
inconsistency as described in the chapter. As i do not have access to 
the
third field, i do not know which data amongst the two is bad. 
Experimental
parameters or the sample used were same at both fields. Is there any 
way to
check this without having data for the third field?

Do you or someone else has a script which can use data from only single
field and let RELAX do model-free analysis?

I looked through the mailing list and have seen that this problem has
been asked and discussed several times. I know about TENSOR2 which can 
do
such an model-free analysis using single field but was wondering if 
some has
found a fix for the RELAX.

Many thanks,
Nav

This will complicate your analysis, as you don't have orientational
information about your NH vectors!  Such information is essential for
the prolate and oblate spheroidal and ellipsoidal diffusion tensors.
You will need to read the relevant literature if this is not clear
(you can find lots of references in the papers linked at
<a  rel="nofollow" href="/features.html#primary_refs">http://www.nmr-relax.com/features.html#primary_refs</a>, especially my
2008a paper at <a  rel="nofollow" href="/refs.html#dAuvergneGooley08a">http://www.nmr-relax.com/refs.html#dAuvergneGooley08a</a>).


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">I learnt from RELAX that one can create

</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

relax does not currently have an algorithm to automatically place
protons into the 'correct position' in 3D space.  This just allows you
to say that protons are attached - hence you will have dipole-dipole
relaxation present.  If you have a 3D structure without protons, you
will need to use Molmol, PyMOL, etc to add the missing protons
yourself prior to loading the structure into relax.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">For model free analysis possibly, i would need a pdb
structure (not entirely sure!); as i can see, an example in the
manual
illustrating without the use of the structure (page 103)
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

You really need to read more of the literature to understand the
reason why.  But you can perform a model-free analysis using the
protocol I developed which is hard-coded into the GUI.  But you can
only use the 'local_tm' and 'sphere' models if no 3D data is present.
If this is not clear why, then you have a lot more reading to do ;)


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">The problem:
When i tried doing it by creating spin systems using amino acid
sequence
alone, the system never got executed. However, when i started doing
it with
structure as an input., it did run but then gave me an error message
for all
the spins as follows:
for spins with all six data parameters:
spin YYY deselected due to absence of any relaxation mechanisms
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

This means that you have not specified the relaxation mechanisms.
Note that if you are looking at 15N backbone data - importantly with
no 13C labelling - then two major relaxation mechanisms are present.
These are the dipole-dipole and CSA interactions.  You will need to
tell relax that these are active, and what the physics for these
interactions should be.  The reason why you have to do this is because
relax can be used for RNA, DNA, or organic molecules.  And even in
proteins, this simple 2 mechanism relaxation may not always be the
case.  For example 15N bb relaxation with 13C labelling, you have 3
direct dipole-dipole relaxation mechanisms, and you have to also take
interference into account.  Or for natural abundance 13C CO relaxation
where only CSA relaxation is present.  relax allows you to handle
these different cases.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">and for spins with no data:
spin YYY deselected due to absence of any data.

the second one is understandable but not sure about the first one .
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Did you follow the tutorial in the relax manual about using the GUI
for model-free analysis, specifically the section on setting up the
relaxation interactions

(<a  rel="nofollow" href="/manual/d_Auvergne_protocol_GUI_mode_relaxation_interactio.html">http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/d_Auvergne_protocol_GUI_mode_relaxation_interactio.html</a>)?


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">To check whether something is wrong with the complete data sets,
i created new data files for only first two residues with structural
coordinates extracted for these two residues. In this case, the
program
worked well.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

You can perform a full analysis using the protocol I developed.  If
this is not clear what this protocol is, please see my 2007 and 2008
papers:

<a  rel="nofollow" href="/refs.html#dAuvergneGooley07">http://www.nmr-relax.com/refs.html#dAuvergneGooley07</a>
<a  rel="nofollow" href="/refs.html#dAuvergneGooley08a">http://www.nmr-relax.com/refs.html#dAuvergneGooley08a</a>
<a  rel="nofollow" href="/refs.html#dAuvergneGooley08b">http://www.nmr-relax.com/refs.html#dAuvergneGooley08b</a>

For residues which have 3D data, you can perform this analysis.  For
missing residues, you may have to use the concept of global model
hybridisation:

<a  rel="nofollow" href="/refs.html#Horne07">http://www.nmr-relax.com/refs.html#Horne07</a>

This will allow you to combine the local tm models for residues
without 3D data with the results from the analysis with 3D data.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Questions from me:
1) Does that mean the absence of data for certain spins, loaded
either from
sequence or structure, causes this problem?
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

No, this is just an indication that you have not set up your active
relaxation mechanisms in relax.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">2)  Can i do the whole analysis just by using the sequence.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Yes, see above.  But it would be much better if you use the 3D info
that you already have, assuming that structure is correct.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">3) Does the software actually need minimum six values (R1, R2 and NOE
at two
fields) for this analysis or it can work with &gt;= 3 values?
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Please read my 2007 and 2008b papers about this!


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">As for some
residues, i have &lt; 6 data values. I am currently ignoring those
residues
with &lt; 6 data values as i wasn't sure if model free analysis would be
able
to handle that.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Again, my publications cover this and what the minimum is and why.
But note that model m8, as I have defined it, has 5 parameters.
Therefore you will require minimally 5 data points.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">4) I am still unclear with the initialization of diffusion tensor. In
the
GUI mode the first row asks for The diffusion tensor parameters:
 I have tried to understand what is written in the manual, but i am
not sure
if i understood it correctly.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

This is also discussed in full detail in my 2007 and 2008b papers as
to why my protocol, which is what you are using when accessing the
relax GUI, requires no initial diffusion tensor.  These papers also
explain the concept behind this protocol and the inversion of the
problem of simultaneously finding the interlinked global diffusion
tensor and spin specific internal motions.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Would you be able to guide/suggest me on this. Any suggestions from
your end
is highly appreciated.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

One other very useful reference which contains the answer to all your
questions (apart from the missing relaxation interaction setup) is my
PhD thesis which you can find at:

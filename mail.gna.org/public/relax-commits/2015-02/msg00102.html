         * Simplified the Test_coordinates.test_common_residues unit test by 
removing many residues.  This is from the 
_lib._structure._internal.test_coordinates unit test module.
         * Expanded the docstring of the 
Test_align_protein.test_align_multiple_from_pairwise unit test.  This is from 
the _lib._sequence_alignment.test_align_protein unit test module.
         * Attempt at fixing the 
lib.structure.internal.coordinates.common_residues() function.  This function 
still does not work correctly.
-        * Renamed the Test_align_protein.test_align_multiple_from_pairwise 
unit test.  This is now the Test_msa.test_central_star unit test of the 
_lib._sequence_alignment.test_msa unit test module (it was originally in the 
_lib._sequence_alignment.test_align_protein unit test module). This is in 
preparation for converting the 
lib.sequence_alignment.align_protein.align_multiple_from_pairwise() function 
into the lib.sequence_alignment.msa.central_star() function.

lib.sequence_alignment.align_protein.align_multiple_from_pairwise() function. 
 This should have been committed earlier.  The function is only partly 
implemented.
         * Initial lib.sequence_alignment.msa.central_star() function.  This 
was moved from 
lib.sequence_alignment.align_protein.align_multiple_from_pairwise().

         * Improvement for the lib.sequence_alignment.msa.central_star() 
function.  The strings and gap matrix returned by the function have been 
reordered to match the input sequences.
         * Modified the Structure.test_align_molecules_end_truncation system 
test.  The calmodulin bound calciums are now deleted prior to the 
structure.align user function call.  This prevents these being labelled as 
'*' residues and aligning with real amino acids via the central star multiple 
sequence alignment (MSA) algorithm.
         * Large speed up of the mol-res-spin selection object.  The 
Selection.contains_mol(), Selection.contains_res() and 
Selection.contains_spin() methods of the lib.selection module have been 
redesigned for speed.  Instead of setting a number of flags and performing 
bit operations at the end of the method to return the correct Boolean value, 
each of the multiple checks now simply returns a Boolean value, avoiding all 
subsequent checks.  The check list order has also been rearranged so that the 
least expensive checks are to the top and the most time intensive checks are 
last.
-        * Created the new relax data store object for saving sequence 
alignments.  This is in the new data_store.seq_align module via the 
Seqence_alignments object, subclassed from RelaxListType, for holding all 
alignments and the Alignment Element object, subclassed from Element, for 
holding each individual alignment.  The objects are currently unused.

         * Added the seq_align module to the data_store package __all__ list.
         * Created the Test_seq_align.test_alignment_addition unit test.  
This is in the _data_store.test_seq_align unit test module.  This tests the 
setup of the sequence alignment object via the 
data_store.seq_align.Sequence_alignment.add() method.

         * The residue number based sequence alignment is now executed when 
assembling atomic coordinates.  This is in the 
assemble_structural_coordinates() function of the pipe_control.structure.main 
module.
         * Modified the internal structural object one_letter_codes() method. 
 This now validates the models to make sure all models match, and the method 
requires the selection object so that residue subsets can be handled.
         * The assemble_atomic_coordinates() function now calls 
one_letter_codes() with the selection object.  This is the 
lib.structure.internal.coordinates module function.
-        * Fix for the residue number based sequence alignment when 
assembling structural coordinates.  This is in the 
assemble_structural_coordinates() function of the pipe_control.structure.main 
module. The sequences of the different molecules can be of different lengths.

assembling structural coordinates.  This is in the 
assemble_structural_coordinates() function of the pipe_control.structure.main 
module.  The sequences of the different molecules can be of different lengths.
         * Shifted the residue skipping data structure construction into the 
relax library.  The code was originally in 
pipe_control.structure.main.assemble_structural_coordinates() but has been 
shifted into the new lib.sequence_alignment.msa.msa_residue_skipping() 
function.  This will also for greater code reuse.  The 
lib.sequence_alignment.msa module is also a better location for such 
functionality.
         * Renamed the Structure.test_sequence_alignment_molecules system 
test.  The new name is 
Structure.test_sequence_alignment_central_star_nw70_blosum62, to better 
reflect what the test is doing.
         * Modified the 
Structure.test_sequence_alignment_central_star_nw70_blosum62 system test.  
Some residues are now deleted so that the sequences are not identical.

         * The structure.sequence_alignment user function now sets some 
arguments to None before storage.  This is for all arguments not used in the 
sequence alignment.  For example the residue number based alignment does not 
use the gap penalties, pairwise alignment algorithm or the substitution 
matrices.
         * Fix for the lib.sequence_alignment.msa.msa_residue_skipping() 
function.  The sequences argument for passing in the one letter codes has 
been removed.  The per molecule loop should be over the alignment strings 
rather than one letter codes, otherwise the loop will be too short.
         * Fix for the internal structural object atomic coordinate assembly 
function.  This is the 
pipe_control.structure.main.assemble_structural_coordinates() function.  The 
case of no sequence alignment being required as only models are being handled 
is now functional.  The strings and gaps data structures passed into the 
lib.sequence_alignment.msa.msa_residue_skipping() function for generating the 
residue skipping data structure are now set to the one letter codes and an 
empty structure of zeros respectively.
-        * Test data directory renaming.  The 
test_suite/shared_data/diffusion_tensor/spheroid directory has been renamed 
to spheroid_prolate. This is in preparation for creating oblate spheroid 
diffusion relaxation data.

be used in the Structure.test_create_diff_tensor_pdb_oblate system test.
         * Fix for the oblate spheroid diffusion relaxation data.  The 
diffusion parameters are constrained as Dx &lt;= Dy &lt;= Dz.
         * More fixes for the Structure.test_create_diff_tensor_pdb_oblate 
system test.  The initial Diso value is now set to the real final Diso, and 
the PDB file contents have been updated for the fixed oblate spheroidal 
diffusion relaxation data.

         * Printout fix for the backend of the structure.translate and 
structure.rotate user functions.  Model numbers of zero were not correctly 
identified.  This also affects the structure.align and structure.superimpose

         * Another fix for the Internal_selection.count_atoms() internal 
structural object selection method.
         * Small fix for the 
lib.structure.internal.coordinates.assemble_coord_array() function.  The 
termination condition for determining the residues in common between all 
structures was incorrect.
-        * The Structure.test_create_diff_tensor_pdb_oblate now uses oblate

(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/bugs/?23232">https://gna.org/bugs/?23232</a>), the failure of this system test on Mac OS X. 
The problem was that the system test was previously using relaxation data for 
prolate spheroidal diffusion and fitting an oblate tensor to that data.  This 
caused the solution to be slightly different on different CPUs, operating 
systems, Python versions, etc. and hence the PDB file representation of the 
diffusion would be slightly different.

diffusion would be slightly different.
         * Big bug fix for the GUI tests on MS Windows systems.  On MS 
Windows systems, the GUI tests were unable to complete without crashing.  
This is because each GUI element requires one 'User object', and MS Windows 
has a maximum limit of 10,000 of these objects.  The GUI tests were taking 
more than 10,000 and then Windows would say - relax, you die now.  The 
solution is that after each GUI test, all user function windows are 
destroyed.  The user function page is a wx.Panel object, so this requires a 
Destroy() call.  But the window is a Uf_page instance which inherits from 
Wiz_page which inherits from wx.Dialog.  Calling Destroy() on MS Windows and 
Linux works fine, but is fatal on Mac OS X systems.  So the solution is to 
call Close() instead.
         * Fix for the default grid_inc argument for the relaxation 
curve-fitting auto-analysis.  This needs to be an integer.
         * Fix for bug #23244 (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/bugs/?23244">https://gna.org/bugs/?23244</a>).  The relaxation 
curve-fitting auto-analysis now outputs text files and Grace graphs for the 
I0 parameter and the Iinf parameter if it exists.
-        * Fixes for the package checking unit tests on MS Windows for the 
target_functions package.  The compiled relaxation curve-fitting file is 
called target_functions\relax_fit.pyd on MS Windows. The package checking was 
only taking into account *.so compiled files and not *.pyd file.

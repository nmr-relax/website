  The scons binary_dist target on Mac OS X can now overwrite a pre-existing 
DMG file.
  
  This is just an argument to the Mac hdiutil program.

 was
  used, where the py2app 'argv_emulation' option is set to false.  For this 
to work in relax, the
  command line argument parsing had to be turned off and default values set 
in the Relax() instance
  namespace.

  r15690 | bugman | 2012-04-05 12:39:02 +0200 (Thu, 05 Apr 2012) | 6 lines
  
  The DMG image file is now being sent to the parent directory '..' rather 
than the base directory.
  
  This fixes the problem of the DMG file packaging itself into 
relax.app/Contents/Resources, creating
  a 120 Mb file rather than a 60 Mb file!!!
........
  r15691 | bugman | 2012-04-05 12:45:20 +0200 (Thu, 05 Apr 2012) | 6 lines
  
  Removed the ppc64 build target for the relax C modules on Mac OS X.
  
  This architecture is not supported by the recent Xcode frameworks, so it 
has been dropped.  ppc64
  users can manually compile the modules, if desired.
........
  r15692 | bugman | 2012-04-10 18:34:29 +0200 (Tue, 10 Apr 2012) | 6 lines
  
  Improved the relax info print out for the installed python packages.
  
  This now shows more information for the wxPython version, and formats the 
output based on maximum
  widths to handle different situations.
........
  r15693 | bugman | 2012-04-10 19:51:37 +0200 (Tue, 10 Apr 2012) | 6 lines
  
  The relax Mac OS X dock icon is now turned off when using the wxGTK build 
of wxPython.
  
  This prevents a little grey frameless window appearing with the largest of 
the relax Ulysses
  butterfly icons in the centre.
........
  r15694 | bugman | 2012-04-11 17:44:21 +0200 (Wed, 11 Apr 2012) | 3 lines

X Frameworks.

  Added a document describing how to build a 3-way (i386, pcc, x86_64) Mac OS 
X Python framework.
  
  This is needed to create the DMG distribution file.

  Fix for the building of the relax C modules as universal binaries on Mac OS 
X.
  
  The linking was not functioning correctly, and the resultant module was 
build only for i386.
........
  r15699 | bugman | 2012-04-12 15:26:50 +0200 (Thu, 12 Apr 2012) | 6 lines
  
  Bug fix for the relax GUI spin viewer window.
  
  When right clicking on nothing in the tree view, an error would occur.  
Now, instead, a special menu
  pops up with a single entry for loading spins.
........
  r15700 | bugman | 2012-04-12 15:53:59 +0200 (Thu, 12 Apr 2012) | 3 lines

  Fix for the text on the 'finish' button of the GUI wizard.

'finish'.
........
  r15702 | bugman | 2012-04-13 09:45:51 +0200 (Fri, 13 Apr 2012) | 5 lines

........
  r15703 | bugman | 2012-04-13 14:16:36 +0200 (Fri, 13 Apr 2012) | 6 lines
  
  Fix for the spin viewer window for wxPython 2.9.3.1.
  
  This 2.9 fix is for when you right click in the tree view panel on nothing, 
and is compatible with
  wxPython 2.8.  This fix will be required for the Mac application which will 
use this version.
........
  r15704 | bugman | 2012-04-13 16:09:35 +0200 (Fri, 13 Apr 2012) | 6 lines
  
  Created a dictionary object containing wxPython version info within the 
status singleton object.
  
  This is being used to construct the Mac dock icon, when the Carbon and 
Cocoa builds and not GTK are
  being used.

zero to expand on 
  demand!

  r15709 | bugman | 2012-04-16 00:01:36 +0200 (Mon, 16 Apr 2012) | 5 lines
  
  Improved details of relax and the compiled C modules from the info print 
out.
  
  The relax introduction has also been removed so it is not printed from the 
sys_info user function.
........
  r15710 | bugman | 2012-04-16 00:03:06 +0200 (Mon, 16 Apr 2012) | 6 lines
  
  Reintroduced the relax intro print out when running in info mode (relax 
--info).
  
  This was removed from the info print out in the last commit, and this 
reintroduces it at the start
  up level.

  Introduced the empty() method into the structure API to check if structural 
data is loaded.
  
  This will be used in the spin loading wizard of the spin viewer window.
........
  r15714 | bugman | 2012-04-16 00:09:08 +0200 (Mon, 16 Apr 2012) | 6 lines
  
  The relax controller now shows the relax intro text to mimic the 
prompt/scripting modes.
  
  Previously the text was being printed prior to the initialisation of the 
controller and was being
  lost.

  Fix for the relax controller find dialog on Mac OS X with wxPython 2.9.

wxPython 2.8 behaviour.

  Redesigned the spin loading wizard.
  
  Now the starting screen allows the choice of the sequence.read, 
structure.read_pdb, and
  structure.read_xyz user functions.  If structural data is already loaded, 
then the option to use the
  pre-loaded structures is also given (which skips to the 
structure.load_spins user function wizard
  page).

  Fix for the about relax window.
  
  On some GTK systems, the font is larger and hence the window will be 
resized to being bigger than
  original hight of 600 px, resulting in the bottom of the window not being 
rendered.
........
  r15723 | bugman | 2012-04-16 14:54:57 +0200 (Mon, 16 Apr 2012) | 7 lines
  
  Fix for the spin loading wizard of the spin window.
  
  The RadioButtons of the first page for selecting the spin loading method 
are now fixed.  With the
  new 2.9.3.1 wxPython version, all options were selected.  Now using the 
wx.RB_GROUP style, the first
  option is the only one initially selected.
........
  r15724 | bugman | 2012-04-16 15:13:23 +0200 (Mon, 16 Apr 2012) | 3 lines

  Fix for the radiobutton group in the Spectral_error_type_page of the peak 
intensity wizard.
  
  The first element of a RadioButton group needs the wx.RB_GROUP style!

  Fix for a bug triggered by wxPython 2.9 when deleting the last analysis tab.
  
  The self.notebook object is now deleted when the set_init_state() method is

........
  r15742 | bugman | 2012-04-16 23:21:24 +0200 (Mon, 16 Apr 2012) | 8 lines
  
  Bug fix for the GUI when deleting analysis tabs.
  
  The deletion of analysis tabs was previously failing in certain cases.  The 
problem was the
  generic_fns.pipes.delete() call in the middle of the delete_analysis() 
method causing a notification
  to be sent to the pipe_deletion GUI observer object, which would then 
handle the pipe deletion prior
  to the completion of the delete_analysis() call causing things to get out 
of sync.
........
  r15743 | bugman | 2012-04-17 10:40:56 +0200 (Tue, 17 Apr 2012) | 5 lines
  
  Added some heavy debugging code to the GUI analysis delete_analysis() 
method.
  
  This will hopefully allow the analysis deletion problems to be finally 
solved.

  Created observer_register() for all GUI analyses for method registration 
and unregistration.
  
  This method allows for external calls to observer_register() to pre-remove 
the methods from the
  observer objects.

  Multiple unregistrations of observer methods are now possible without a 
RelaxError.
  
  This allows multiple code paths to unregister methods to allow for 
pre-removal of methods to avoid
  queued wx events in wxGTK from occurring on dead or missing objects.

prior to deletion.

  Big bug fix for the deletion of analyses tabs from the GUI!
  
  This affects wxGTK users on Macs and Linux.  Now the spectrum and 
relaxation data list GUI elements
  have observer_register() methods, allowing the analysis delete_all() method 
to unregister all
  analysis specific methods from the observer objects.  This prevents queued 
wx calls to be made on
  dead or non-existent GUI objects after the analysis has been deleted.  
wx.Yield() calls were not
  sufficient to solve this issue.

  Bug fix for the spin.create user function GUI interface for when molecules 
or residues are not named.
  
  Unnamed molecules are now properly handled in the GUI page, and the residue 
name of None is properly
  converted into a NoneType prior to executing the back end.

as the spin.create fn.
  
  The unnamed molecules are now properly handled, and the gui_to_*() methods 
are now used for data

  Added a flag to the status singleton object to signal if text output can be 
coloured.
  
  This is only activated when sys.stdout has not been changed.  Unix 
redirection and pipes will need
  to be handled later

  Fix for the initialisation of the Exec_info class for the prompt/script 
output.
  
  The class was not being initialised at all!  Thought the variables were 
class rather than instance
  variables, so the problem was hidden.

  The sys.std*.isatty() methods are now being used to determine if text 
output should be coloured.
  
  This removes the need for the status.text_colouring flag, and can handle 
changes in IO redirection
  occurring at any point.  This was suggested at both

the following conventions should be followed.
+% Submitting changes to the relax project.
+%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+\section{Submitting changes to the relax project}
+
+
+% Submitting changes as a patch.
+\subsection{Submitting changes as a patch}
+
+The preferred method for submitting fixes and improvements to the relax 
source code is by the creation of a patch.  If your changes are a fix, make 
sure you have submitted a bug report to the bug tracker located at 
\href{<a  href="https://gna.org/bugs/?group=relax}{https://gna.org/bugs/?group=relax}">https://gna.org/bugs/?group=relax}{https://gna.org/bugs/?group=relax}</a> 
first.  See section~\ref{reporting bugs} on page~\pageref{reporting bugs} for 
more details.  Two methods can be used to generate the patch, either using 
the Unix command \texttt{diff} or using the Subversion program.  The 
resultant file \texttt{patch} of either the \texttt{diff} or \texttt{svn} 
command described below can be posted to the ``relax-devel at gna.org'' 
mailing list.  Please label within your post which version of relax you 
modified or which revision the patch is for.  Also try to create a commit log 
message according to the format described in section~\ref{commit log format} 
on page~\pageref{commit log format} for one of the relax committers to use as 
a template for committing the change.

+% Modification of official releases -- creating patchs with diff.
+\subsection{Modification of official releases -- creating patchs with diff}
+
+If your modifications have been made to the source code of one of the 
official relax releases (for example 1.2.2), then the Unix command 
\texttt{diff} can be used to create a patch.  A patch file is simply the 
output of the diff command used recursively and presented in the `unified' 
format.  Therefore two directories need to be compared.  If the original 
sources are located in the directory \texttt{relax\_orig} and the modified 
sources in \texttt{relax\_mod}, then the patch can be created by typing
+
+\example{\$ diff -ur relax\_orig relax\_mod &gt; patch}
+
+
+% Modification of the latest sources -- creating patchs with Subversion.
+\subsection{Modification of the latest sources -- creating patchs with 
Subversion}
+
+If possible, changes to the latest sources is preferred.  Using the most up 
to date sources from the relax SVN repository will significantly aid the 
relax developers to incorporate your changes back into the main development 
line.  To check out the current development line, see section~\ref{svn 
repository} on page~\pageref{svn repository} for details.  Prior to 
submitting a patch to the mailing list, your sources should be updated to 
include the most recent changes.  To do this, type
+
+\example{\$ svn up}
+
+and note the revision number to include in your post.  The update may cause 
a conflict if changes added to the repository clash with your modifications.  
If this occurs, see the Subversion book at 
\href{<a  href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/}{http://svnbook.red-bean.com/}">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/}{http://svnbook.red-bean.com/}</a> for details 
on how to resolve the conflict or submit a message to the relax-devel list.
+
+Once the sources are up to date, your changes can be can be converted into 
the patch text file.  Using SVN, creating a patch is easy.  Just type
+
+\example{\$ svn diff &gt; patch}
+
+in the base relax directory.

+\section{Committers}
+
+
+% Becoming a committer.
+\subsection{Becoming a committer}
+
+After proving oneself, anyone can become a relax developer and obtain commit 
access to the relax repository.  The main criteria for selection by the relax 
developers is to show good judgement, competence in producing good patches, 
compliance with the coding and commit log conventions, comportment on the 
mailing lists, not producing too many bugs, only taking on challenges which 
can be handled, and the skill in judging your own abilities.  You will also 
need to have an understanding of the concepts of version control, 
specifically those relating to Subversion.  The SVN book at 
\href{<a  href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/}{http://svnbook.red-bean.com/}">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/}{http://svnbook.red-bean.com/}</a> contains 
all the version control information you will need.  After a number of patches 
have been submitted and accepted, any of the relax developers can propose 
that you receive commit access.  If a number of developers agree while no one 
says no, then commit access will be offered.
+
+One area where coding ability can be demonstrated is within the relax test 
suite.  The addition of tests, especially those where the relax internal data 
structures of \texttt{self.relax.data} are scrutinised, can be a good 
starting point for learning the structure of relax.  The beauty of the tests 
is that the introduction of bugs has no effect on normal program execution.  
The relax test suite is an ideal proving ground.
+
+If skills in only certain areas of relax development, for example in 
creation of the documentation, an understanding of C but not python, an 
understanding of solely the code of the user interface, or an understanding 
of the code specific to a certain type of data analysis methodology, then 
partial commit access may be granted.  Although you will have the ability to 
make modifications to any part of the repository, please make modifications 
only those areas for which you have permission.
 
 
 % Format of the commit logs.
 \subsection{Format of the commit logs}\label{commit log format}
 
+If you are a relax developer and you have commit access to the repository, 
the following conventions should be followed.
+
 The length of all lines in the commit log should never exceed 100 
characters.  This is so that the log message viewed in either emails or by 
the command prompt command \mbox{\texttt{svn log}} is legible.  The first 
line of the commit log should be a short description or synopsis of the 
changes.  The second line should be blank.
 
 If the commit is a bug fix reported by someone else or if the commit 
originates from a patch posted by someone else, the next lines should be 
reserved for crediting.  The name of the person and their obfuscated email 
address (for example edward at nmr-relax.com) should be included in the 
message.
@@ -109,55 +156,6 @@
 If the commit relates to an entry in the bug tracker or to a discussion on 
the mailing lists, then the web address of either the bug report or the 
mailing list archive message should be cited in the next section (separated 
from the synopsis or credit section by a blank line).  All relevant links 
should be included to allow easy navigation between the repository, mailing 
lists, bug tracker, etc.  An example is bug \#5559 which is located at 
\href{<a  href="https://gna.org/bugs/?func=detailitem\&amp;item\_id=5559}{https://gna.org/bugs/?func=detailitem\&amp;item\_id=5559}">https://gna.org/bugs/?func=detailitem\&amp;item\_id=5559}{https://gna.org/bugs/?func=detailitem\&amp;item\_id=5559}</a>
 and the post to ``relax-devel at gna.org'' describing the fix to that bug 
which is located at 
\href{<a  href="https://mail.gna.org/public/relax-devel/2006-03/msg00013.html}{https://mail.gna.org/public/relax-devel/2006-03/msg00013.html}">https://mail.gna.org/public/relax-devel/2006-03/msg00013.html}{https://mail.gna.org/public/relax-devel/2006-03/msg00013.html}</a>.

should follow a blank line, can itself be sectioned using blank lines, and 
finally the log is terminated by one blank line at the end of the message.

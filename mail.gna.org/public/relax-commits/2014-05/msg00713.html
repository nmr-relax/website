  Created a file selection wildcard for use in the GUI for selecting peak 
lists.
  
  This is used in the four user functions which read peak lists.

    Systemtest Relax_disp.test_cpmg_synthetic_cr72_full_noise_cluster
    changes from 7 seconds to 4.5 seconds.
    
    This is won by not checking single values in the R2eff array for math 
domain
    errors, but calculating all steps, and in one single round check for 
finite values.
    If just one non-finite value is found, the whole array is returned with a 
large
    penalty of 1e100.
    
    This makes all calculations be the fastest numpy array way.

    This is after commit 23216:
    The systemtest uses: GRID_INC = None, which have found to be 
catastrophic: <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?22032">https://gna.org/bugs/?22032</a>.
    Commit 23216 fixed this, and now the found minimization point is much 
much better.

    task #7793: (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/task/?7793">https://gna.org/task/?7793</a>) Speed-up of dispersion models.
    
    This was found necessary after commit 23216.
    
    It is suspected that when relax have touched boundary values which made
    math domain errors, the error cathing have created local minima or
    interfered with the simplex search algorithm.

    This is to implement catching of math domain errors, before they occur.
    These can be found via the --numpy-raise function to the systemtests.
    
    To make the code look clean, the class object &quot;back_calc&quot; is no longer
    being updated per time point, but is updated in the relax_disp target 
function in
    one go.

    This is to implement catching of math domain errors, before they occur.
    These can be found via the --numpy-raise function to the systemtests.
    
    The skipping of test when num_points &gt; 0, is a bad implementation.
    If such a case should show, it is best to catch the wrong input for the
    calculations. This is best done with a check before running the 
calculations.

    A weird behaviour was found when running the test-suite.
    
    Somehow, queued jobs from the last test suite was not flushed and done.
    Running the test-suite gave errors on almost all tests.
    
    Inspecting systemtest which only used calc() for the dispersion API, 
showed that no jobs was queued
    in the calculate() method, and the call to processor.run_queue(), was 
turned off, solving the problem.

    Fix for commit 23246.
    
    <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/relax?view=revision&amp;revision=23246">http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/relax?view=revision&amp;revision=23246</a>
    
    The testing taking a value to a power was performed wrong.
    
    This made systemtest 
Relax_disp.test_hansen_cpmg_data_auto_analysis_numeric
    not working.

    Math-domain catching for model TSMFK01.
    
    task #7793: (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/task/?7793">https://gna.org/task/?7793</a>) Speed-up of dispersion models.
    
    This is to implement catching of math domain errors, before they occur.
    These can be found via the --numpy-raise function to the systemtests.
    
    To make the code look clean, the class object &quot;back_calc&quot; is no longer
    being updated per time point, but is updated in the relax_disp target 
function in
    one go.

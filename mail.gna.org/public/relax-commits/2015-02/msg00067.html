  Updates for many of the Diffusion_tensor system tests.
  
  This is due to the changed directory names in

  Big bug fix for the GUI tests on MS Windows systems.
  
  On MS Windows systems, the GUI tests were unable to complete without 
crashing.  This is because each
  GUI element requires one 'User object', and MS Windows has a maximum limit 
of 10,000 of these
  objects.  The GUI tests were taking more than 10,000 and then Windows would 
say - relax, you die
  now.
  
  The solution is that after each GUI test, all user function windows are 
destroyed.  The user
  function page is a wx.Panel object, so this requires a Destroy() call.  But 
the window is a Uf_page
  instance which inherits from Wiz_page which inherits from wx.Dialog.  
Calling Destroy() on MS
  Windows and Linux works fine, but is fatal on Mac OS X systems.  So the 
solution is to call Close()
  instead.
........
  r27445 | bugman | 2015-02-03 09:20:10 +0100 (Tue, 03 Feb 2015) | 13 lines
  
  Large improvement for the GUI test tearDown() clean up method, fixing the 
tests on wxPython 2.8.
  
  The user function window destruction has been shifted into a new 
clean_up_windows() method which is
  executed via wx.CallAfter() to avoid racing conditions.  In addition, the 
spin viewer window is
  destroyed between tests.
  
  The spin viewer window change allows the GUI tests to pass on wxPython 2.8 
again.  This also allows
  the GUI tests to progress much further on Mac OS X systems before they 
crash again for some other
  reason.  This could simply be hiding a problem in the spin viewer window.  
However it is likely to
  be a racing problem only triggered by the super fast speed of the GUI tests 
and a normal user would
  never be able to operate the GUI on the millisecond timescale and hence may 
never see it.

  Reverted r27243, the skipping of the GUI tests on wxPython 2.8.
  
  The command used was:
  svn merge -r27243:r27242 .
  
  This was discussed at 
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.devel/7502/focus=7512">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.devel/7502/focus=7512</a>.

    Changed paths:
       M /trunk/test_suite/test_suite_runner.py
    
    The GUI tests are now skipped for wxPython version &lt;= 2.8 due to bugs 
causing fatal segfaults.
    
    This follows from 
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.devel/7502">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.devel/7502</a>.  These wxPython
    versions are simply too buggy.

  Reverted r27325, the General.test_bug_23187_residue_delete_gui GUI test is 
no longer disabled.
  
  The command was:
  svn merge -r27325:r27324 .
  
  The 'Bus Error' on Mac OS X due to this test is no longer an issue, as the 
spin viewer window is now
  destroyed after each GUI test.
  
  .....

    Changed paths:
       M /trunk/test_suite/gui_tests/general.py
    
    Disabled the General.test_bug_23187_residue_delete_gui GUI test.
    
    This is essential as a wxPython bug in Mac OS X systems causes this test 
to trigger a 'Bus Error'
    every time the GUI tests are run, killing relax.

  r27449 | bugman | 2015-02-03 10:07:09 +0100 (Tue, 03 Feb 2015) | 9 lines
  
  Created a special Destroy() method for the spin viewer window.
  
  This is for greater control of the spin viewer window destruction.  First 
the methods registered
  with the observer objects are unregistered, then the children of the spin 
viewer window are
  destroyed, and finally the main spin viewer window is destroyed.  This 
change saves a lot of GUI
  resources in the GUI tests (there is a large reduction in 'User Objects' 
and 'GDI Objects' used on
  MS Windows systems, hence an equivalent resource reduction on other 
operating systems).
........
  r27450 | bugman | 2015-02-03 10:14:45 +0100 (Tue, 03 Feb 2015) | 16 lines
  
  Fix for the GUI test clean_up_windows() method called from tearDown().
  
  The user function window (Wiz_window) must be closed before the user 
function page (Uf_page), so
  that the Wiz_window._handler_close() can still operate the methods of the 
Uf_page.  This avoids a
  huge quantity of these errors:
  
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File &quot;/data/relax/relax-trunk/gui/wizards/wiz_objects.py&quot;, line 723, in 
_handler_close
      self._pages[self._current_page].on_next()
    File 
&quot;/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/wx-2.8-gtk2-unicode/wx/_core.py&quot;, line 
14615, in
  __getattr__
      raise PyDeadObjectError(self.attrStr % self._name)
  wx._core.PyDeadObjectError: The C++ part of the Uf_page object has been 
deleted, attribute access no
  longer allowed.
........
  r27451 | bugman | 2015-02-03 10:26:56 +0100 (Tue, 03 Feb 2015) | 6 lines
  
  Simplification of the Dead_uf_pages.test_mol_create GUI test.
  
  The RelaxError cannot be caught from the GUI user function window, 
therefore the try statement has
  been eliminated.
........
  r27452 | bugman | 2015-02-03 10:48:10 +0100 (Tue, 03 Feb 2015) | 6 lines
  
  More memory saving improvements for the GUI test suite tearDown() method.
  
  The clean_up_windows() method now loops through all top level windows 
(frames, dialogs, panels,
  etc.) and calls their Destroy() method.
........
  r27453 | bugman | 2015-02-03 12:11:34 +0100 (Tue, 03 Feb 2015) | 5 lines
  
  Created the gui.uf_objects.Uf_object.Destroy() method.
  
  This will be used to cleanly destroy the user function object.
........
  r27454 | bugman | 2015-02-03 12:17:11 +0100 (Tue, 03 Feb 2015) | 6 lines
  
  Modified the GUI test suite _execute_uf() method.
  
  This user function execution method now calls the user function GUI object 
Destroy() method to clean
  up all GUI objects.  This should save memory for GUI objects in the GUI 
test suite.
........
  r27455 | bugman | 2015-02-03 12:20:51 +0100 (Tue, 03 Feb 2015) | 7 lines
  
  Modified the GUI test suite tearDown() method.
  
  The clean_up_windows() method called by tearDown() now prints out a lost of 
all of the living
  windows instead of trying to destroy them (which causes the running of the 
GUI tests in the GUI to
  cause the GUI to be destroyed).  The printouts will be used for debugging 
purposes.

  Import fix and copyright update.
........
  r27457 | bugman | 2015-02-03 12:25:11 +0100 (Tue, 03 Feb 2015) | 7 lines
  
  Fixes for the custom Wiz_window.Destroy() method.
  
  This will now first close the wizard window via the Close() method to make 
sure all of the wizard
  pages are properly updated.  In the end the wizard DestroyChildren() method 
is called to clean up
  all child wx objects, and finally Destroy() is called to eliminate the 
wizard GUI object.

  r27458 | bugman | 2015-02-03 12:28:05 +0100 (Tue, 03 Feb 2015) | 5 lines
  
  The GUI test suite tearDown() method now calls the user function GUI wizard 
Destroy() method.
  
  This is for better handling of user function elimination.

  Fixes for the user function GUI object Destroy() method.
  
  This matches the code just deleted in the GUI test suite tearDown() method 
for handing the user
  function page object.
........
  r27460 | bugman | 2015-02-03 12:31:23 +0100 (Tue, 03 Feb 2015) | 6 lines
  
  More fixes for the user function GUI object Destroy() method.
  
  This page GUI object is destroyed by the wizard window Destroy() method, so 
destroying again causes
  wxPython runtime errors.
........
  r27461 | bugman | 2015-02-03 12:37:10 +0100 (Tue, 03 Feb 2015) | 5 lines
  
  Spacing printout for the list of still open GUI window elements.
  
  This is for the GUI test tearDown() method.
........
  r27462 | bugman | 2015-02-03 14:11:32 +0100 (Tue, 03 Feb 2015) | 6 lines
  
  Shifted the printouts from the GUI tests suite clean_up_windows() method to 
the tearDown() method.
  
  This change means that the printouts are not within a wx.CallAfter() call, 
but rather at the end of
  the tearDown() method just prior to starting the next test.
........
  r27463 | bugman | 2015-02-03 14:51:32 +0100 (Tue, 03 Feb 2015) | 8 lines
  
  Simplification of the GUI analysis post_reset() method.
  
  This now uses the delete_all() and hence delete_analysis() methods to clean 
up the GUI.  The reset
  argument has been added to skip the manipulation of relax data store data, 
as the data store is
  empty after a reset.  However the calling of the delete_analysis() method 
now ensures that the
  analysis specific delete() method is now called so that the GUI elements 
can be properly destroyed.
........
  r27464 | bugman | 2015-02-03 14:56:21 +0100 (Tue, 03 Feb 2015) | 6 lines
  
  Proper destruction of the peak analysis wizard of the NOE GUI analysis.
  
  The peak wizard's Destroy() method is now called and the self.peak_wizard 
object deleted in the NOE
  GUI analysis delete() method.
........
  r27465 | bugman | 2015-02-03 14:58:20 +0100 (Tue, 03 Feb 2015) | 7 lines
  
  Improved memory management in the NOE GUI analysis peak_wizard_launch() 
method.
  
  This method was just overwriting the self.peak_wizard object with a new 
object.  However this does
  not destroy the wxPython window.  Now if a peak wizard is detected, its 
Destroy() method is called
  before overwriting the object.
........
  r27466 | bugman | 2015-02-03 15:02:41 +0100 (Tue, 03 Feb 2015) | 7 lines
  
  Improved GUI clean up when terminating GUI tests.
  
  The clean_up_windows() method, called from tearDown(), now also destroys 
the pipe editor window, the
  results viewer window, and the prompt window.  This ensures that all of the 
major relax windows are
  destroyed between GUI tests.

  Improved memory management in the relaxation curve-fitting GUI analysis.
  
  The peak intensity loading wizard is now properly destroyed.  This is both 
via the delete() function

peak_wizard_launch()
  method calling the wizard Delete() method prior to overwriting the 
self.peak_wizard object with a
  new GUI wizard.

  Improved memory management in the model-free GUI analysis.
  
  The dipole-dipole interaction wizard is now properly destroyed.  This is 
both via the delete()

  setup_dipole_pair() method calling the wizard Delete() method prior to 
overwriting the
  self.dipole_wizard object with a new GUI wizard.

  Improved termination of the GUI tests.
  
  The clean_up_windows() method now calls the results viewer and pipe editor

  Changes for how the main GUI windows are destroyed by the GUI test 
tearDown() method.
  
  These changes revert some of the code of previous commits.  The recently 
introduced pipe editor and
  results viewer windows Delete() methods have been deleted.  Instead the 
Close() methods are called
  in the tearDown() method to unregister the windows from the observer 
objects, followed by a
  wx.Yield() call to flush the wx events, and then the clean_up_windows() GUI 
test base method is
  called within a wx.CallAfter() call.  This avoids the racing induced 
segfaults in the GUI tests.

    Changed paths:
       M /trunk/gui/wizards/wiz_objects.py
    
    Wizard window objects in the GUI can now be named.
    
    This will help with debugging the GUI memory usage.

  Improved memory management in the relaxation data list GUI element, as well 
as the base list object.
  
  The relaxation data loading wizard is now destroyed in the 
Base_list.delete() method, or any wizard
  for that matter.  In addition, the relaxation data loading wizard is 
destroyed before reinitialising
  the wizard in the wizard_exec() method.

  Better memory management for the missing data dialog in the GUI analyses.
  
  The dialog is now stored as the class variable missing_data, and then is 
destroyed in the analysis
  delete() method.  Without this, the wxPython dialog would remain in memory 
for the lifetime of the
  program.

  Improved memory management for the Sequence and Sequence_2D input GUI 
elements.
  
  These are mainly used in the user function GUI windows.  The dialogs are 
now destroyed before a
  second is opened.

  Improved memory management for the GUI user function windows.
  
  The Destroy() method will now destroy any Sequence or Sequence_2D windows 
used for the user function
  arguments.

  The relax prompt window is now being destroyed by the GUI test suite 
tearDown() method.
  
  The window is first closed in the tearDown() method and then destroyed in 
the clean_up_windows()
  method.

  Added memory management checking to the GUI test suite tearDown() method.
  
  If any top level windows are present, excluding the main GUI window and the 
relax controller, then a
  RelaxError will be raised.  Such a check will significantly help in future 
GUI coding, as now there
  will be feedback if not all windows are properly destroyed.

This is a major feature release focusing on more complete Mac OS X<br>

support and prettifying all of the user interfaces (UIs).  The new<br>

features include full Mac OS X support via fink and the Mac<br>

application DMG file (for Leopard, Snow Leopard and Lion with PPC,<br>

i386 and x86_64 CPUs), coloured terminal output in the prompt/script<br>

UI modes, the ability to run the full relax test suite within the GUI<br>

mode, general improvements throughout the GUI, support for wxPython<br>

2.9, faster program start up, improved formatting of the HTML version<br>

of the user manual, and expansion of the multi-processor framework.<br>

Many additional changes are listed below.  If you are a Mac OS X user,<br>

you are affected by one of the bugs listed below, or you would like to<br>

use the new features, then I would recommend upgrading to this new<br>

version.<br>

<br>

The new relax versions can be downloaded from either<br>

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nmr-relax.com/download.html" target="_blank">http://www.nmr-relax.com/download.html</a> or<br>

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://download.gna.org/relax/" target="_blank">http://download.gna.org/relax/</a>
<div id=":14t">.  If binary distributions are not yet<br>
available for your platform and you manage to compile the binary<br>
modules, please consider contributing these to the relax project<br>
(described in section 3.6 of the relax manual,<br>
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/" target="_blank">http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/</a>).<br>
<br>
The full list of changes is:<br>
<br>
    Features:<br>
        * Large improvements to the HTML user manual<br>
(<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/index.html</a>).<br>
        * The full test suite, including GUI tests, can now be run<br>
successfully from the GUI.<br>
        * The Mac OS X binary distribution file now supports Leopard,<br>
Snow Leopard and Lion as well as the PPC, i386 and x86_64 CPU<br>
architectures.<br>
        * The prompt and script output to a terminal is now coloured.<br>
        * Faster program startup by only importing the test suite and<br>
GUI packages if they are actually needed.<br>
        * Files selected via the GUI user functions can now be previewed.<br>
        * Redesign of the spin loading wizard of the spin viewer<br>
window to be more intuitive.<br>
        * Expansion of the system information print out.<br>
        * Advances in the multi-processor framework including the<br>
pre-sending of data to slaves.<br>
        * Support for wxPython 2.9.<br>
<br>
<br>
    Changes:<br>
        * Changed all of the maths in the HTML user manual page<br>
titles, the latexonly and htmlonly environments are now being used to<br>
produce different section titles with and without maths respectively.<br>
        * The latex2html configuration script now allows for more<br>
maths in the HTML user manual with the HTML_VERSION math extension.<br>
        * The section numbers are now removed from the HTML user<br>
manual pages to allow for more static webpages for the user functions<br>
which do not disappear as new user functions are added.<br>
        * The title page of the HTML user manual has been renamed to<br>
&quot;The relax user manual&quot;.<br>
        * Updated the ancient COMMITTERS file which has not been<br>
changed in over 4 years!<br>
        * The pipe editor window is no longer centred, now matching<br>
the behaviour all other windows.<br>
        * All open relax windows are now closed prior to running the<br>
test suite within the GUI.<br>
        * Exiting the GUI now only warns about data loss only if there<br>
is data to loose.<br>
        * The relax controller can now not be closed while the test<br>
suite is running.<br>
        * During the GUI tests from the GUI, the relax controller is<br>
now modal preventing users from interfering with the tests.<br>
        * The relax controller now stays on top of all windows when<br>
the GUI tests are being run improving the running of the tests on Mac<br>
OS X and MS Windows.<br>
        * The GUI tests now work in the GUI thanks to a lot of GUI<br>
black magic.  The tests&#39; tearDown() method now carefully deconstructs<br>
the GUI element prior to the next test being run.  In the normal<br>
&#39;relax --gui-test&#39; mode, the GUI object is destroyed and recreated for<br>
each test however, when run from the GUI, the GUI object is always<br>
there and must remain intact.  The deconstruction includes deletion of<br>
each analysis tab and selective destruction of all non-main windows<br>
(excluding the controller which shows the test suite progress).  The<br>
relax data store GUI object is also reconstructed in the tearDown()<br>
method, and all wx events flushed at the very end to prevent clashes<br>
with the next GUI test.<br>
        * The relax mode (i.e. prompt, script, GUI, test suite, etc.)<br>
is now stored in the status object - this is used to activate and<br>
deactivate certain parts of the GUI tests within the GUI and normal<br>
test suite modes.<br>
        * The ds.relax_gui GUI data object is now a permanent feature<br>
of the relax data store.<br>
        * The &#39;Tools-&gt;Test suite&#39; menu item has been converted into a<br>
sub-menu with entries for running all tests or the individual test<br>
categories.<br>
        * Created the _det_install_path() status singleton method for<br>
better determining the install path - this is used for the Mac OS X<br>
applications whereby the current logic of using sys.path[0] fails<br>
miserably!<br>
        * Prepared the multi-processor package for the import<br>
mechanisms of Python 3 - this new mechanism is present in Python 2.7<br>
now, and the code falls back to the old method when not present.<br>
        * Complete redesign of the py2app setup.py script for building<br>
Mac OS X applications.  The script has been converted into a class<br>
called Setup which performs all the actions.  All files, source or<br>
otherwise, are now stated as data files to be included in<br>
relax.app/Contents/Resources.  All relax modules are specified by the<br>
py2app &#39;includes&#39; option so that they are forced to all be included<br>
within the relax.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.X/site-packages.zip<br>
file as *.pyc files.<br>
        * The py2app part of the setup.py script now throws a<br>
RelaxError if the setuptools module is missing.<br>
        * Added the relax prompt icon to the main GUI window toolbar.<br>
        * Added the larger sized application-x-executable-script Oxygen icons.<br>
        * Created the &#39;ansi&#39; module containing the terminal colouring<br>
ANSI escape sequences.<br>
        * The test suite is now only imported in the test modes of<br>
operation - this should speed up program initialisation.<br>
        * The import of the gui package now only occurs in GUI mode -<br>
this will speed up the program start up.<br>
        * The script print out in scripting mode is now in cyan if<br>
sys.stdout is a TTY.<br>
        * ANSI escape characters are now turned off forcibly when in GUI mode.<br>
        * The sys.std*.isatty() methods are being used to determine if<br>
text output should be coloured.<br>
        * All RelaxWarnings are now coloured yellow when printed to a TTY.<br>
        * All RelaxErrors are now coloured red when printed to a TTY.<br>
        * The relax prompts will be coloured blue when printed to a TTY.<br>
        * The GUI analyses delete_all() method now unregisters all<br>
observer methods prior to deletion.<br>
        * Created observer_register() for all GUI analyses for method<br>
registration and unregistration - this method allows for external<br>
calls to observer_register() to pre-remove the methods from the<br>
observer objects.<br>
        * Added debugging printouts to the delete_all() analysis method.<br>
        * More advanced debugging printouts for the delete_analysis() method.<br>
        * Added some heavy debugging code to the GUI analysis<br>
delete_analysis() method.<br>
        * Increased the size of the model-free model change warning<br>
dialog for wxPython 2.9 on GNU/Linux.<br>
        * The file selection wizard GUI element now has the preview<br>
button turned on by default.<br>
        * Double clicking on a file in the results view window now opens it.<br>
        * Added a file preview button for the<br>
spectrum.read_intensities user function GUI page.<br>
        * Added a file preview button to the file selection GUI<br>
element of the wizards.<br>
        * Increased the size of the incomplete set up dialogs for<br>
wxPython 2.9 on GNU/Linux.<br>
        * Added the document-preview.png Oxygen icons.<br>
        * Increased the loading state warning dialog size - this is to<br>
accommodate for larger text on wxPython 2.9 on GNU/Linux with GTK.<br>
        * Improved the spin data deletion messages from the spin viewer window.<br>
        * Increased the dialog heights for the deletion of spin data<br>
via the spin viewer window.<br>
        * Improved the user feedback during a state save by just<br>
sleeping a little to show the busy cursor.<br>
        * Modified the spin loading wizard so that preloaded<br>
structures are the default.<br>
        * The maths_fns.relax_fit module is now stored in the<br>
dep_check module for the info print out.<br>
        * Added the structure.read_xyz user function to the menus.<br>
        * Created the Tools-&gt;System Information menu entry, which is<br>
simply the sys_info user function front end.<br>
        * Created the GUI front end to the structure.read_xyz user function.<br>
        * The relax controller now accepts Ctrl-A to select all text.<br>
        * The relax controller now shows the relax intro text to mimic<br>
the prompt/scripting modes.<br>
        * Introduced the empty() method into the structure API to<br>
check if structural data is loaded - this will be used in the spin<br>
loading wizard of the spin viewer window.<br>
        * Converted the structure.read_xyz user function front end to<br>
the new design.<br>
        * Improved details of relax and the compiled C modules from<br>
the info print out.<br>
        * Created a dictionary object containing wxPython version info<br>
within the status singleton object - this is being used to construct<br>
the Mac dock icon, when the Carbon and Cocoa builds and not GTK are<br>
being used.<br>
        * Updated the multi-processor package __all__ list to allow<br>
the relax unit tests to pass.<br>
        * Added a document describing how to build a 3-way (i386, pcc,<br>
x86_64) Mac OS X Python framework.<br>
        * Added a script which is used to validate the binary<br>
architecture of Mac OS X Frameworks.<br>
        * Improved the relax info print out for the installed python<br>
packages - this now shows more information for the wxPython version,<br>
and formats the output based on maximum widths to handle different<br>
situations.<br>
        * Removed the ppc64 build target for the relax C modules on<br>
Mac OS X - this architecture is not supported by the recent Xcode<br>
frameworks, so it has been dropped.<br>
        * The scons binary_dist target on Mac OS X can now overwrite a<br>
pre-existing DMG file.<br>
        * Added some epydoc @attention fields to the multi-processor API.<br>
        * Created the fetch_data_store() multi-processor API function<br>
- this simply returns the data store of the same processor as the<br>
calling code.<br>
        * The 2nd test implementation&#39;s slave command now uses the<br>
fetch_data() API function - this is to obtain the invariant data<br>
pre-sent by the master to the slaves.<br>
        * Renamed the multi-processor API data_fetch() function to<br>
fetch_data(), and implemented it.<br>
        * Renamed data_upload() to send_data_to_slaves() and made it<br>
more specific.<br>
        * The multi-processor data_fetch() API function is now used to<br>
obtain the total_length variable.<br>
        * Shifted the self.threaded_result_processing flag into the<br>
base Processor class where it belongs.<br>
        * Clean up and completion of the TODO for the<br>
Processor.assert_on_master() method.  The Processor.assert_on_master()<br>
method has been created and calls raise_unimplemented().  The<br>
Multi_processor.assert_on_master() method has been shifted to<br>
Mpi4py_processor.assert_on_master(), as that method&#39;s error message is<br>
MPI specific.  The empty Uni_processor.assert_on_master() method has<br>
been added to allow that fabric to work.<br>
        * Spun out all of the results queue objects into their own<br>
module.  This completes another set of TODOs by removing these queue<br>
objects from any fabric level.  They can now be imported and used by<br>
any fabric level (Processor, Multi_processor, Mpi4py_processor,<br>
Uni_processor, etc.).<br>
        * Shifted the run_command_queue() and run_queue() methods from<br>
the Multi_processor to Processor class.<br>
        * The multi/test_implementation2.py script can now be run in<br>
uni-processor mode.<br>
        * The multi/test_implementation2.py script now properly uses<br>
pre-send data in the slave calculations.<br>
        * Partially implemented the Processor.data_update() method.<br>
        * Created the special command object Slave_storage_command for<br>
transferring data to slaves - this command currently has two special<br>
methods:  add(), used by the master processor to add data to the<br>
command for transfer; and clear(), used by the slave (via run()) or<br>
the master to clear out all data.<br>
        * Split the multi.commands module into two - the slave<br>
commands and result commands.<br>
        * Removed the Mpi_processor.data_upload() method as this will<br>
be performed at the Processor level.<br>
        * Shifted all of the processor command objects into the<br>
multi.commands module.  The other multi.api module objects have been<br>
shifted into the multi.misc module.<br>
        * The multi-processor package now allows sys.exit() calls<br>
within the master processor.<br>
        * Removed a number of sys.exit() calls from different relax<br>
modes.  The return call is used rather than sys.exit() to exit the<br>
main run() method.  These were not needed and it allows the &#39;version&#39;,<br>
&#39;info&#39;, and &#39;gui&#39; modes to play better with the multi-processor<br>
package when using mpi4py.<br>
        * Shifted the mpi4py processor module functions<br>
broadcast_command() and ditch_all_results() into the class - these<br>
have been turned into private methods.<br>
        * Redesigned how the multi-processor package terminates<br>
program execution - the Processor.exit() method has been introduced to<br>
perform this action.<br>
        * Spelling fix for a number of the processor method names.<br>
        * Fully documented the Processor.run() method via comments.<br>
        * Eliminated the unused Set_processor_property_command<br>
multi-processor class.<br>
        * Eliminated the unused Get_name_command multi-processor class.<br>
        * Shifted the Multi_processor.run() method up a level to<br>
Processor.run() - this completes one of the TODOs, and will be needed<br>
to avoid code duplication for handling the new data_upload() and<br>
data_fetch() API methods.<br>
        * Eliminated the completely unused create_slaves() Processor method.<br>
        * The processor instances now have a data storage container -<br>
this will be used by the data_upload() and data_fetch() API methods.<br>
        * Implemented the mpi4py processor fabric data_upload() method.<br>
        * Updated the second multi-processor test implementation to<br>
use the new data_upload() API function.<br>
        * The multi.data_upload() API function now forwards the call<br>
to the Processor classes.<br>
        * Clean up of the Multi_processor.run_command_queue() method.<br>
<br>
<br>
    Bugfixes:<br>
        * Fix for the about dialogs in the GUI when combined with a<br>
scrolling window (this is only a problem for the wxPython 2.9 series).<br>
        * Fix for the fetch_docstrings.py script used for the user<br>
manual creation - the number of \linebreak[0] commands inserted was<br>
far too great.<br>
        * In generating the HTML user manual, the ignore_commands<br>
function is now being used to force latex2html to ignore \linebreak[0]<br>
commands as these were previously putting the text &#39;[0]&#39; throughout<br>
all the HTML pages.<br>
        * For the HTML user manual, the document splitting has been<br>
restored to a split depth of 5 - this had been changed to make the<br>
main chapters of the text more readable, but the user function HTML<br>
page is now far, far too long and is a massive strain on browsers.<br>
        * The Mf.test_write_results system test now works with the<br>
newer Python 2.7.3 version, as from this version onwards the XML of<br>
the relax save and results files will be differently formatted.<br>
        * Big bug fix for the installation path for the relax Mac OS X<br>
application.  The path to the application Resources folder, where all<br>
the relax data files are located, is now set to the install path.  The<br>
relax.py module was also overwriting the value set in the status<br>
singleton and now this no longer occurs.<br>
        * Fix for the py2app setup.py script for Mac OS X application<br>
creation - the list of data files to include with the app is now<br>
properly formatted.<br>
        * The relax GUI is now robust and able to withstand a call to<br>
the reset user function - this could have occurred if the user ran a<br>
script with a reset() call, or if reset() was typed at the GUI version<br>
of the relax prompt.<br>
        * Added isatty() methods to all of the dummy file objects<br>
within relax - this fixes a number of errors caused by the recent<br>
introduction of coloured text.<br>
        * Fix for the initialisation of the Exec_info class for the<br>
prompt/script output.<br>
        * Fix for the residue.create user function GUI front end - the<br>
unnamed molecules are now properly handled, and the gui_to_*() methods<br>
are now used for data conversion.<br>
        * Fix for the gui_to_int() function for when text instead of<br>
an integer is given by the user.<br>
        * Bug fix for the spin.create user function GUI interface for<br>
when molecules or residues are not named - unnamed molecules are now<br>
properly handled in the GUI page, and the residue name of None is<br>
properly converted into a NoneType prior to executing the back end.<br>
        * Big bug fix for the deletion of analyses tabs from the GUI -<br>
this affects wxGTK users on Macs and Linux.  Now the spectrum and<br>
relaxation data list GUI elements have observer_register() methods,<br>
allowing the analysis delete_all() method to unregister all analysis<br>
specific methods from the observer objects.<br>
        * Multiple unregistrations of observer methods are now<br>
possible without a RelaxError - this allows multiple code paths to<br>
unregister methods to allow for pre-removal of methods to avoid queued<br>
wx events in wxGTK from occurring on dead or missing objects.<br>
        * Bug fix for the GUI when deleting analysis tabs - the<br>
deletion of analysis tabs was previously failing in certain cases.<br>
        * Fix for a bug triggered by wxPython 2.9 when deleting the<br>
last analysis tab - the self.notebook object is now deleted when the<br>
set_init_state() method is called, allowing it to be properly accessed<br>
and recreated.<br>
        * Converted the pipe switching with GUI tab switching to<br>
synchronous to avoid rare races (triggered by wxPython 2.9).<br>
        * The analysis deletion buttons now do nothing if the notebook<br>
is not created yet - this avoids problems on the new wxPython 2.9<br>
versions.<br>
        * Fix for the radiobutton group in the<br>
Spectral_error_type_page of the peak intensity wizard.<br>
        * Fix for the spin loading wizard of the spin window - the<br>
RadioButtons of the first page for selecting the spin loading method<br>
are now fixed.<br>
        * Fix for the about relax window size for wxPython 2.9.<br>
        * Fix for the relax controller find dialog on Mac OS X with<br>
wxPython 2.9.<br>
        * wxPython 2.9 fix for the spin viewer window (at least for Mac OS X).<br>
        * The maximize calls for the spin viewer window are now turned<br>
off for Mac OS X systems (this is a fix for the fink versions of<br>
relax).<br>
        * Bug fix for Mac OS X - the main window is no longer started<br>
maximised (a fix for the fink version of relax).<br>
        * Fix for the spin viewer window for wxPython 2.9 - this is<br>
for when you right click in the tree view panel on nothing.<br>
        * Fix for the text on the &#39;finish&#39; button of the GUI wizard -<br>
this was accidentally changed to &#39;apply&#39;.<br>
        * Bug fix for the spectrum.replicated user function for when<br>
it is called twice with the same IDs.<br>
        * Bug fix for the relax GUI spin viewer window.  When right<br>
clicking on nothing in the tree view, an error would occur.  Now,<br>
instead, a special menu pops up with a single entry for loading spins.<br>
        * Fix for the building of the relax C modules as universal<br>
binaries on Mac OS X - the linking was not functioning correctly, and<br>
the resultant module was build only for i386.<br>
        * The relax Mac OS X dock icon is now turned off when using<br>
the wxGTK build of wxPython from fink - this prevents a little grey<br>
frameless window appearing with the largest of the relax Ulysses<br>
butterfly icons in the centre.<br>
        * Bug fix for Mac OS X - attempt at killing the<br>
Carbon.Evt.TickCount problem by removing argv emulation.<br>
        * Fix for the scons binary_dist target on Mac OS X systems<br>
with multiple Python versions - now the py2app program is called with<br>
the same python version as used by scons.<br>
        * Fix for the Processor.data_upload() method.  The<br>
self.run_command_queue() method is no longer being used.  Instead the<br>
add_to_queue() method is being used to queue up the slave commands,<br>
and the run_queue() method is being called at the end to flush the<br>
queue.<br>
        * Fixes and clean up of the slave to master transfer mechanism<br>
for result commands.<br>
        * Fix for the relax info print out on Python 2.5 or below.</div>

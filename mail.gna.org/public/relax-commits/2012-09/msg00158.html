 \section{The new protocol in the GUI}
 
-The model-free analysis can be performed within the GUI (see 
Figure~\ref{fig: screenshot: model-free analysis} on page~\pageref{fig: 
screenshot: model-free analysis}).  This analysis is that of the automated 
d'Auvergne protocol.  From the analysis wizard (Figure~\ref{fig: screenshot: 
analysis wizard} on page~\pageref{fig: screenshot: analysis wizard}), this 
automated model-free analysis can be selected.  This analysis will use the 
new model-free protocol described in Section~\ref{sect: new model-free 
protocol} on page~\pageref{sect: new model-free protocol}.
-
-The GUI is designed to be robust -- you should be able to set up all the 
input data and parameters in any order, with relax giving warning is 
something is missing.  The analysis will only execute once everything is 
correctly set up.  If this is not the case, rather than starting the 
analysis, clicking on the \guibutton{Execute relax} button will warn about 
the incorrect set up, describing what the problem is.  Below, a tutorial on 
how to use the GUI will be presented with screenshots.
-
-If the \gui{Protocol mode} field is left to the \gui{Fully automated} 
setting then, after clicking on \guibutton{Execute relax}, the calculation 
can be left for one to two weeks to complete.  It is highly recommended to 
check the log messages in the relax controller window, at least at the start 
of the analysis, to make sure that all the data is being read correctly and 
everything is set up as desired.  All warnings should be carefully checked as 
these can indicate a fatal problem.  If you would like to log all the 
messages into a file, relax can be run with:

 \example{\$ relax -g --log log}
 
 Note that the size of this \file{log} file could end up being in the 
gigabyte range for a model-free analysis.
 
-For the full analysis to complete, for a protein system this may take 
between one to two weeks.  To speed up the calculations, if you have access 
to multiple cores and/or hyper-threading, the GUI can be run using Gary 
Thompson's multi-processor framework (see section~\ref{sect: multi-processor} 
on page~\pageref{sect: multi-processor}).  For example on a dual-CPU with 
dual-core system, four calculations can be run simultaneously.  In this case, 
the GUI can be launched with:

 \subsection{d'Auvergne protocol GUI mode -- the rest of the setup}
 
-The local $\tau_m$ models and model-free models should not be modified, the 
reason for this is explained in section~\ref{sect: d'Auvergne protocol script 
variables} on page~\pageref{sect: d'Auvergne protocol script variables}.  The 
grid search increments defaults to \guistring{11}.  This is used in the 
optimisation of the individual model-free models for each spin.  This value 
should also not be touched unless you know what you are doing (and have read 
\citet{dAuvergneGooley08a}).  The number of Monte Carlo simulations can be 
increase but, for accurate errors estimates, it should not be less than 500 
simulations.  One additional setting is the \gui{Maximum iterations}.  This 
is a maximum number of times the protocol will iterate before terminating.  
This allows infinite loops to be broken.  The value of 30 iterations should 
be fine for most analyses.

     - AltLoc is the place holder to indicate alternate conformation. The 
alternate conformation can be in the entire polymer chain, or several 
residues or partial residue (several atoms within one residue). If an atom is 
provided in more than one position, then a non-blank alternate location 
indicator must be used for each of the atomic positions. Within a residue, 
all atoms that are associated with each other in a given conformation are 
assigned the same alternate position indicator. There are two ways of 
representing alternate conformation- either at atom level or at residue level 
(see examples).
     - For atoms that are in alternate sites indicated by the alternate site 
indicator, sorting of atoms in the ATOM/HETATM list uses the following 
general rules:

with alternate sites,  the coordinates occur one after  the other in the 
entry.

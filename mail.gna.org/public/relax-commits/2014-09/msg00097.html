is a verbose representation of the spin information which can be used for 
presenting to the user.  Functions for shorter string versions will also be 
of great use, for example as described by Troels at

         * Created a unit test for the 
pipe_control.mol_res_spin.format_info_full() function.  This comprehensive 
test covers all input argument combinations.
         * Changed the behaviour of the 
pipe_control.structure.mass.pipe_centre_of_mass() function.  This function 
returns the CoM and optionally the mass of the structural data loaded into 
the current data pipe.  However it was matching the structural data to the 
molecule-residue-spin data structure and skipping spins that were deselected. 
 This illogical deselection part has been eliminated, as spins can be 
deselected for various analysis purposes and this should not change the CoM.  
The deletion also significantly speeds up the function.
-        * Added a minfx minimum version check to the dep_check module.  This 
is to avoid problems such as that reported at bug #22408 
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://gna.org/bugs/?22408">http://gna.org/bugs/?22408</a>).
         * Added Andy Baldwin's 2013 R1rho relaxation dispersion model (BK13) 
to the manual.  The model has been added to the table of dispersion models 
and to the dispersion software comparison table of the dispersion chapter of 
the manual.  The citation has also been added to the bibliography.
         * The BK13 dispersion model is now properly added to the software 
comparison table.
         * Added the 'BK13' and 'BK13 full' dispersion models to the to do 
section of the manual.

         * Improved data checking for all of the Structure system tests.  
Before looping over the structural data, the number of lines in the real file 
and the newly generated file are compared.  This avoids the situation whereby 
an empty file is produced, accidentally allowing the test to pass.
         * Modified following functions (time points are now saved at the 
[ei][mi][oi][di] index level, at this index level all time points are saved 
for the R2eff point):  interpolate_disp(), to interpolate time points, all 
time points through the original dispersion points di, are collected and then 
made unique - this time list can potentially be the largest of all time 
lists;  interpolate_offset(), to interpolate time points, all time points 
through the original offset points, and then dispersion points di, are 
collected and then made unique - this time list can potentially be the 
largest of all time lists;  plot_disp_curves_to_file(), to acquire the 
original relax_times points;  return_r2eff_arrays(), to save all time points 
on the level of [ei][mi][oi][di].  At this index level, it will be a numpy 
array list with all time values used for fitting.  Bug #22461

         * Fix to system test Relax_disp.test_r1rho_kjaergaard_missing_r1().  
After the relaxation times have been fixed, this model now return reasonable 
chi2 values.  The reported parameters are though quite different from all 
other models, and it seems something may still be wrong.  Bug #22461

spin.isotope was not set.  The new call to return_r2eff_arrays(), when 
producing graphs, raise RelaxSpinTypeError() if no isotope is set.  Bug

         * Correction for catastrophic implementation of Monte Carlo 
simulations for exponential curve-fitting R2eff values in the dispersion 
analysis.  A wrong implemented &quot;else if&quot; statement, would add the intensity 
for the simulated intensity together with the original intensity.  This means 
that all intensity values send to minimisation would be twice as high than 
usually (if spectra were not replicated).  This was discovered for Monte 
Carlo simulations of R2eff errors in exponential fit.  This will affect all 
analyses using full relaxation exponential curves until now.  By pure luck, 
it seems that the effect of this would be that R2eff errors are half the 
value they should be.  A further investigation shows, that for the selected 
data set, this had a minimum on influence on the fitted parameters, because 
the chi2 value would be scaled up by a factor 4.  Bug #22554 
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/bugs/?22554">https://gna.org/bugs/?22554</a>): The distribution of intensity with errors in

associated errors for exponential curve fitting.

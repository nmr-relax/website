    Dear Edward &amp; Michael,<br>
    <br>
    I wish you some nice holidays and a good start into the new year.<br>
    <br>
    The last time I had sent you examples of the PDC ouput. I would
    assume that you can easily<br>
    read it via Python and that your Python programs are flexible. I
    will make sure that the format<br>
    stays in its essential components, i.e. values are tab separated and
    the sections start with<br>
    the keywords used so far.<br>
    <br>
    May I ask if you in what detail you read other keywords ?<br>
    <br>
    Example:<br>
    The section with the integrals looks like:<br>
    <br>
    SECTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; used integrals<br>
    Mixing time [s]:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.01&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.03 .........<br>
    <br>
    Would you suffer if I changed Mixing time into Mixing times ? Or do
    you just read a token up to : ?<br>
    <br>
    The reason why I'm asking that someone looked through export and
    report and found such minor<br>
    differences. Other examples are that in between the tab separated
    title lines of the tables, e.g.<br>
    the title line &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Peak name&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; F1[ppm]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F2[ppm] ....&nbsp;
    sometimes additional spaces are contained,<br>
    sometimes 2, sometimes 3.<br>
    <br>
    Do you evaluate these title lines at all&nbsp; or just the relevant table
    that follows ?<br>
    <br>
    Early next year we should write down which parts of the output must
    no be changed by myself <br>
    to avoid conflicts.<br>
    <br>
    Best regards,<br>
    Peter<br>
    <br>

This is not good at all!  We will need to wait until the website is
back up.  The mailing lists and other infrastructure seems to be still
functional though.

For the attachments of large files, this should not be done on a
public mailing list as it causes big problems with internet traffic
and the Gna! infrastructure.  It is broadcast out to many people and
the message (and attached files) are archived across the internet (for
example <a rel="nofollow" class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.mail-archive.com/relax-devel@xxxxxxx/">http://www.mail-archive.com/relax-devel@xxxxxxx/</a>).  So it puts
a lot of strain on the system.  It is best to attach it to the task
<a rel="nofollow" class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://gna.org/task/?7180">https://gna.org/task/?7180</a>, but this link will not work until the Gna!
website is back up.  Big attachments should be caught though and the
message blocked.

The new files look quite good and seem to have the complete
information needed.  And the higher precision should avoid truncation
errors sneeking into the subsequent model-free analysis.  Just to be
sure with the errors, if we have:

Peak name          F1 [ppm]       F2 [ppm]           T2[s]         error          scale
Gln [2]     122.508           8.898        0.1752        0.0026246        222814

Then the unscaled error for this T2 is 0.005847976244?

I will take a look at the manual and see what we can do.  We have to
now implement the code to read the PDC files, though this should be
trivial with the current file format.  For the text, it can possibly
be expanded by following from the previous chapter and explaining the
models M6-M9 and TM6-TM9, the ellipsoidal diffusion, etc.  Maybe that
the user has full flexibility with relax to do as they wish, the can
do reduce spectral density mapping or model-free analysis, perform
model-free analysis in any way they wish, but if they have data at 2
or more field strengths they can take advantage of the automatic
protocols.  relax now has a GUI, thanks to Michael Bieri, but it might
be better to wait until that is published.  I might try to come up
with some text, but that will probably have to wait a number of days.

Cheers,

Edward

Hi,

accessing your various links causes problems, either I get something like
"The requested URL /task/index.php was not found on this server." or there is
some security issue.

In any case, I have implemented the average variance method as discussed and also
changed the export functionality. Doing more changes in the export area is no problem
if needed. The changes so far include that besides integrals or decay rates also the
corresponding errors are shown in a further table/section. Concerning the fit parameter
output I have added a column called scale. This value (always the same for a given
confidence value and number of degrees of freedom was multiplied to the error obtained
by fit or MC. You can just do the reverse. Finally, I have added more digits and more
infos. e.g. which method was used to calculate systematic errors.

May I just attach examples to this mail.

One of the next things I should certainly enhance is our manual. I will also attach a copy of
that. The last chapter contains a very short part referring to relax. There, I should certainly
do more. We might also think to describe more details of relax itself just as an advertisement,
what do you think ? If you want to provide some (unformatted) text or other pictures I can
add those. The current PDC version is now 1.1.3 a next version is roughly planned for early
January since I have to switch between projects in between.

Best regards,
Peter

Hi,

I've converted the scripts to Java for a reference (and to see how
quick I can learn Java ;) which surprisingly wasn't very hard).  These
can be accessed at <a rel="nofollow" class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://gna.org/task/index.php?7180#comment4">https://gna.org/task/index.php?7180#comment4</a>.  I'll
take the data you included in the post, and calculate what the error
estimates should be using the 3 different methods and send another
message with the results.

Cheers,

Edward


P.S.  As you mention, the error is the sqrt of the mean variance.

Hi,

sorry, I didn't find enough time to look at your scripts so far. I'm not a python programmer but the PDC is in
Java which is not so far away from python.

I ran my calculation again with a t1 dataset. 2 Mixing times (0.1s and 0.5s) were replicated. Below there
is a listing of the the peaks, each with pairwise measured intensities and the calculated variance. As you see the
average variance is much higher than the differences. One should finally take the sqrt of the mean variance,
right ?



suppose we have mixing times   10, 10, 10 (3 replicates)
                               20
                               30, 30 (2 replicates)
                             40
                              50

and spectra with 3 peaks.

A:
I would take peak1, then check for the largest difference in intensity in the first 3 replicates and in the 2 replicates.
The largest found difference is then assigned as a systematic error to peak1 at all mixing times.

Is an absolute value is used for finding the maximum difference?  So
say in the mixing time of 10, the intensities are 1, 4, 2 so the max
difference is 3.  And in the 30 has intensities of 0.9 and 3.  So the
error of peak 1 would be 3.  Is this correct?

yes



I think A: and C: should be offered. After implementing this I see my data that the C: produces much larger
errors than A and the errors of the fitted parameters get much larger, sometimes larger than the values itself.
This seems not acceptable.

&gt;From my tests, the errors should be bigger with the A procedure.  This

is strange!  It might be worth seeing if the C procedure
implementation matches that in
<a rel="nofollow" class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://gna.org/support/download.php?file_id=11440">https://gna.org/support/download.php?file_id=11440</a>.  I may have also
have made a mistake within the logic of these testing scripts!

If one takes the sqrt of the average variance then indeed method A produces somewhat larger errors.

I think, I offer A (our current method) together with C (your method).

Best regards,
Peter

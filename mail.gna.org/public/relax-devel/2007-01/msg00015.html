<pre style="margin: 0em;">mailRedesign of the relax data model: 1. Why change?</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;"><br>On Wed, 2006-10-11 at 17:02 +1000, Edward d'Auvergne wrote:</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">   This post is proposal for the redesign the relax data model.  This will
   affect how data is input into the program, how data is selected, how
   molecular structures are handled, how spin systems are handled, and how
   many other parts of relax function.  Importantly the internal structure
   of 'self.relax.data' will completely change.  These modifications will
   essentially break every part of relax (the isolated code in the
   directories 'minimise', 'maths_fns', and 'docs' will be safe from the
   carnage, as will a few files in the base directory).  If you have any
   ideas for extending or improving the proposed data model, can see any
   short-comings, deficiencies, or flaws, are familiar with the PDB
   conventions, etc., your input is very much sought after.  The changes
   should occur in the 1.3 line of the repository.  1.2 versions will be
   unaffected - scripts will remain compatible and the 1.2 line will
   continue to be supported with bug fixes, etc.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">   I have to apologise in advance for the size of this proposal, to
   simplify it I have divided the text into numbered sections.  Once this
   initial parent message has been sent I will respond to it with the text
   of the 4 major sections.  This will allow 4 major threads to branch off
   from this message on the mailing list archive
   (<a  href="https://mail.gna.org/public/relax-devel">https://mail.gna.org/public/relax-devel</a>).  If you have an opinion,
   idea, etc. about a specific section, could you please post a separate
   message in response to the relevant major section post?  Also if you
   have unrelated ideas for one of these sections, could you post these as
   separate messages as well?  For example if you have separate points
   about sections 3.1 and 3.5.1, two different posts responding to the
   parent Section 3 post would be appreciated.  Thanks.  This will help to
   focus each discussion point into specific threads.</pre><br>

<pre style="margin: 0em;">....</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;"><br>As a general comment if redesign of relax is in progress it would be
worth thinking of what the best exemplars of object oriented design
are and to study them. This is in some way made easy as the current
orthodoxy is well described by object orientated models
(<a  href="http://ootips.org/ood-principles.html">http://ootips.org/ood-principles.html</a>,
<a  href="http://www.accu.org/acornsig/public/articles/ood_intro.html">http://www.accu.org/acornsig/public/articles/ood_intro.html</a>) and the
idea of design patterns
(<a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_</a>(computer_science) ).
Design patterns highlight patterns of software design that have been
found to work in a number of systems (anti-patterns do the opposite)
and therefore have been tested in the wild. I would recommend a quiet
evenings reading curled up with Gamma, Erich; Richard Helm, Ralph
Johnson, and John Vlissides (1995). Design Patterns: Elements of
Reusable Object-Oriented Software, hardcover, 395 pages,
Addison-Wesley. ISBN 0-201-63361-2. could provide some useful input.
As you can see this is not the only book on patterns that is in the
wild but is the classic.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">The other classic thing is to go through (again?) the structures,
nouns and verbs that are present in you head about the structure,
data, and organization of relax  and relaxation systems and think of
them as objects and then think if they would model well into relax.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">e.g. structure
      pipe
      algorithm
      data -  tensor
             -  model
            ....
Certainly there are areas where relax is not very object orientated or
shows some anti patterns. Thus for example self.relax is a very wide
interface which references all the functions in relax as objects many
of which just use there __init__ to save yet another copy of relax
into self.relax. Is this structure still needed when we have a global
relax variable? Surely most of these functions would be better as
static methods  of just plain functions in modules and the internals
of the relax class would  become much cleaner and leaner. Furthermore
much more organizational overhead would be passed off to the
pythonpath and python import infrastructure... In general classes are
not needed for things that don't have state....</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">I hope this all helps and doesn't sound too critical ;-)</pre><br>

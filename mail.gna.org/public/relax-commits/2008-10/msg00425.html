Log:
Rewrote the spectrum.error_analysis() user function docstring.

This is still missing 3 sections for error analysis with the volume 
integration methods.

-        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-        The variance for a single spin at a single time point is calculated 
by the formula:
+        &quot;&quot;&quot;Function for performing an error analysis for peak intensities.
+
+        Description
+        ~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+        This user function must only be called after all peak intensities 
have been loaded and all
+        other necessary spectral information set.  This includes the 
baseplane RMSD and the number
+        of points used in volume integration, both of which are only used if 
spectra have not been
+        replicated.
+
+        Six different types of error analysis are supported depending on 
whether peak heights or
+        volumes are supplied, whether noise is determined from replicated 
spectra or the RMSD of the
+        baseplane noise, and whether all spectra or only a subset have been 
duplicated.  These are:

+        Peak heights with baseplane noise RMSD
+        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+        When none of the spectra have been replicated, then the peak height 
errors are calculated
+        using the RMSD of the baseplane noise, the value of which is set by 
the
+        spectrum.baseplane_rmsd() user function.  This results in a 
different error per peak per
+        spectrum.  The standard deviation error measure for the peak height, 
sigma_I, is set to the
+        RMSD value.

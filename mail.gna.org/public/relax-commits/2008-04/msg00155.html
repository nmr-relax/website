  Created a new directory for the new 'structure' package.
  
  This will eventually contain numerous structure related operations 
including:
  
  A number of PDB parsers,
  A PDB writer,
  CIF parsers,
  Other structural data file parsers,
  Functions for creating geometric objects in structural format,
  Mass and inertia related functions.
  
  This package will eventually have a well defined API for accessing 
structural data independent of
  the structure parser used.

  been shifted from generic_fns to structure.
........
  r5290 | bugman | 2008-04-04 12:01:52 +0200 (Fri, 04 Apr 2008) | 3 lines

  Modifications to the structure.read_pdb() user function.
  
  The 'parser' argument has been added to allow different PDB parsers to be 
selected in the future.
  To allow for the new relax design, the docstring has been updated with 
respect to the loading of the
  sequence and the 'spin_id' argument has been added to allow the selection 
of specific atoms of the
  PDB file to be placed as SpinContainers in the relax data store.

 After proving oneself, anyone can become a relax developer and obtain commit 
access to the relax repository.  The main criteria for selection by the relax 
developers is to show good judgement, competence in producing good patches, 
compliance with the coding and commit log conventions, comportment on the 
mailing lists, not producing too many bugs, only taking on challenges which 
can be handled, and the skill in judging your own abilities.  After a number 
of patches have been submitted and accepted, any of the relax developers can 
propose that you receive commit access.  If a number of developers agree 
while no one says no, then commit access will be offered.
 
-One area where coding ability can be demonstrated is within the relax test 
suite.  The addition of tests, especially those where the relax internal data 
structures of \texttt{self.relax.data} are scrutinised, can be a good 
starting point for learning the structure of relax.  The beauty of the tests 
are that the introduction of bugs has no effect on normal program executiong. 
 The relax test suite is an ideal proving ground.
-
-If skills in only certain areas of relax development, for example in 
creation of the documentation, an understanding of C but not python, an 
understanding of solely the code of the user interface, or an understanding 
of the code specific to a certain type of data analysis methodology, then 
partial commit access may be granted.  Although you will have the ablity to 
make modifications to any part of the repository, please make modifications 
only those areas for which you have permission.

 One of the philosophies in the construction of relax is that if there is 
something which is not immediately obvious, then that is considered a design 
bug.  If any flaws in relax are uncovered, including general design flaws, 
bugs in the code, or documentation issues, these can be reported within 
relax's bug tracker system.  The link to submit a bug is

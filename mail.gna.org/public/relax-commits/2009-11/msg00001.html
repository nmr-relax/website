machines!

  Fix for the test_opt_constr_newton_gmw_mt_S2_0_970_te_2048_Rex_0_149() 
system test.
  
  The 2 different f and g count values on 64-bit GNU/Linux are now checked.  
This difference is
  present even when the same Python and numpy versions are used, and is 
therefore likely to be gcc
  or the blas/lapack libraries causing differences.

  Replaced all instances of `x` with repr(x).
  
  This was down with the python 2.x to 3.x script with the commands:
  2to3 -f repr . -w
  2to3 -f repr relax -w
  
  The change is in preparation for Python 3.0, and relax still works with 
Python versions 2.4, 2.5,
  and 2.6.

  The Python 2.x idioms have been removed.
  
  This was done with the python 2.x to 3.x script with the commands:
  2to3 -w -f exec relax .

      3) list sort methods x.sort() have been replaced with a call to 
sorted(x).
  
  Booleans are instances of int, so the user function argument unit tests 
will be a massive mess!

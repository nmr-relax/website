  Changed the order of the Rx curve-fitting and NOE chapters in the relax 
manual.
  
  This is because the NOE chapter references passages from the Rx 
curve-fitting chapter, so it's more
  logical to have the Rx curve-fitting chapter first.

  The command used was:
  svn merge -r17456:17455 .

with svn...

  Editing of the &quot;Values, gradients, and Hessians&quot; chapter of the user manual 
to make it fit better.
  
  The context of this chapter has been specified by changing the title to 
&quot;Optimisation of relaxation
  data -- values, gradients, and Hessians&quot; and the intro text has been 
updated.  As this chapter is no
  longer straight after the model-free chapter, this is needed.

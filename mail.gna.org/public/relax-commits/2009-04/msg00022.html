  Added a line with the relax URL (<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://nmr-relax.com">http://nmr-relax.com</a>) in the script 
docstring.
  
  This is in case someone has the script and not relax.

  Fix for bug 13032: Bug in structure.create diff tensor pdb
  
  The Dz unit  in dependency_generator() were erroneous, inputing 'alpha' and 
'beta' instead of 'beta' and 'gamma'.
  
  This had the effect of creating a weird shaped ellipsoid diffusion tensor 
representation when 'alpha' and 'beta' were set to unequal values.
  
  This is now fixed, yielding properly shaped diffusion tensor 
representations for any angles 'alpha', beta' and 'gamma'.
................
  r8980 | semor | 2009-03-16 19:59:34 +0100 (Mon, 16 Mar 2009) | 11 lines
  
  Changed units of model-free parameters in the test suite results file 
according to r8977.
  
      ns -&gt; seconds
      ps -&gt; seconds
      Angstrom -&gt; meters
      x MHz -&gt; sigma_ex = Rex / omega**2
      ppm -&gt; unitless
  
  The bzipped file was changed directly with vim. The system tests now pass 
without error,
................

................
  r8990 | bugman | 2009-03-20 17:44:37 +0100 (Fri, 20 Mar 2009) | 5 lines
  
  Made the call to cdp.structure.bond_vectors() more fault tolerant.

different structures!

  Modified the model elimination print out to show the data pipe name.
  
  This was picked up while trying to debug bug #13259 
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?13259">https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?13259</a>).

  Removed the check for spin selection so that determine_model_type() works 
with nothing selected.
  
  This is a partial response to bug #13259 
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?13259">https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?13259</a>) reported by

  Modified the structure.vectors() user function to fail if no vectors are 
found.

  This bug was reported by Pierre-Yves Savard (pierre-yves dot savard att bcm

  The bug may not be completely gone yet.
................

  Fix for the regression of bug #12607 (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/bugs/?12607">https://gna.org/bugs/?12607</a>).
  
  The determine_model_type() method now handles the strange case where no 
spins are selected
  (gracefully).
................
  r9010 | bugman | 2009-04-15 14:33:53 +0200 (Wed, 15 Apr 2009) | 5 lines
  
  Expanded the test_read_pdb_internal3() and test_read_pdb_scientific3() 
system tests.
  
  Now the reading of atomic positions from different models is tested.
................
  r9011 | bugman | 2009-04-15 15:28:15 +0200 (Wed, 15 Apr 2009) | 6 lines
  
  Removed a test in load_spins() causing a bug.
  
  This test is totally unnecessary as the structures are not created if they 
already exist.  This was
  causing only the position from the first model to be extracted, if ave_pos 
was False.
................
  r9015 | bugman | 2009-04-27 15:26:25 +0200 (Mon, 27 Apr 2009) | 5 lines

object.

  The problem was that global minimisation objects were being accessed when 
the do not exist.  These
  are now skipped.

    Fix for the noe.read_constraints() user function.
    
    The noe object is called noe_obj.
  ........
    r8163 | bugman | 2008-12-08 16:46:53 +0100 (Mon, 08 Dec 2008) | 7 lines
    
    The noe.read_constraints() user function now calls 
generic_fns.noesy.read_constraints().
    
    The noe user functions need not all point to the specific NOE object!  
Maybe later the steady-state
    NOE can be separated from the NOESY, but for now it isn't too illogical 
for both to be in the same
    user function class.

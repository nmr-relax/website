  r9528 | bugman | 2009-09-18 14:04:52 +0200 (Fri, 18 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Created the euler_zyz_to_axis_angle() conversion function.
........
  r9529 | bugman | 2009-09-18 14:28:37 +0200 (Fri, 18 Sep 2009) | 6 lines
  
  Created axis_angle_to_euler_zyz().
  
  The test_euler_zyz_to_euler_zyz() unit test now checks both 
euler_zyz_to_axis_angle() and
  axis_angle_to_euler_zyz().
........
  r9530 | bugman | 2009-09-18 17:38:27 +0200 (Fri, 18 Sep 2009) | 12 lines
  
  Final 1.3 line redesigns of the relax_io module.
  
  The log() and tee() functions have been renamed to io_streams_log() and 
io_streams_tee(), and the
  old IO.logging_off() class method has been converted to the 
io_streams_restore() function.  The
  io_streams_restore() function is also differently designed, using the true 
original IO streams
  (sys.__stdin__, sys.__stdout__, and sys.__stderr__).
  
  The IO.delete() method has been converted to a module function.
  
  The IO class has been eliminated.
........
  r9531 | bugman | 2009-09-18 18:19:26 +0200 (Fri, 18 Sep 2009) | 6 lines
  
  Created a module for alignment tensor related system tests.
  
  Only the single test test_to_and_from_xml() has been created so far.  This 
checks the dumping and
  reloading of alignment tensors into an XML file.
........
  r9532 | bugman | 2009-09-18 18:26:40 +0200 (Fri, 18 Sep 2009) | 5 lines
  
  Bug fix for the delete function.
  
  The function was failing if the file was missing!
........
  r9533 | bugman | 2009-09-18 18:28:05 +0200 (Fri, 18 Sep 2009) | 6 lines
  
  Bug fix for the test suite.
  
  The temporary files were not always deleted if a .bz2 extension was added!  
Now relax_io.delete() is
  being called to fix this.
........
  r9534 | bugman | 2009-09-18 18:28:56 +0200 (Fri, 18 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Reactivated the system tests turned off in r9533.
........
  r9535 | bugman | 2009-09-18 18:32:41 +0200 (Fri, 18 Sep 2009) | 5 lines
  
  Fix for the data_names() method for when no model has been setup.
  
  This allows the frame order data pipe to be written out prior to the model 
setup.
........
  r9536 | bugman | 2009-09-18 18:43:02 +0200 (Fri, 18 Sep 2009) | 3 lines

  r9539 | bugman | 2009-09-18 19:15:06 +0200 (Fri, 18 Sep 2009) | 6 lines
  
  Reverted r9538.  The wrong file was committed!
  
  The command used was:
  svn merge -r9538:9537 .
........
  r9540 | bugman | 2009-09-18 19:15:40 +0200 (Fri, 18 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Try again:  Added the blacklist arg to xml_to_object().
........
  r9541 | bugman | 2009-09-18 19:18:14 +0200 (Fri, 18 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Bug fix, the blacklist args now default to [].
........
  r9542 | bugman | 2009-09-18 19:19:39 +0200 (Fri, 18 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Fix for the test_to_and_from_xml() check of the 'reduction' data structure.
........
  r9543 | bugman | 2009-09-18 19:20:15 +0200 (Fri, 18 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  The 'reduction' data structure is now properly created from the XML file.
........
  r9544 | bugman | 2009-09-21 13:25:14 +0200 (Mon, 21 Sep 2009) | 6 lines
  
  Modified the frame order grid search.
  
  The angle end points are now avoided (as they are the same as the start 
points) and the beta Euler
  angle increments are halved, as the search is half of that of alpha and 
gamma (0 to pi).
........
  r9545 | bugman | 2009-09-21 13:53:39 +0200 (Mon, 21 Sep 2009) | 5 lines
  
  Removed the end point of the cone angle from the grid search.
  
  This is unrestricted motion, so is physically not possible.
........
  r9546 | bugman | 2009-09-21 14:03:55 +0200 (Mon, 21 Sep 2009) | 5 lines
  
  Also halved the number of theta polar angle increments in the frame order 
grid search.
  
  This is to match the cone axis azimuthal angle phi.
........
  r9547 | bugman | 2009-09-21 16:20:58 +0200 (Mon, 21 Sep 2009) | 6 lines
  
  Fix for the missing PDB file error.
  
  The extension '.pdb' was being added to the end so if the missing file 
'1F3Y.pdb' was specified,
  the RelaxError would say that '1F3Y.pdb.pdb' was missing.
........
  r9548 | bugman | 2009-09-21 18:44:14 +0200 (Mon, 21 Sep 2009) | 7 lines
  
  Complete redesign of the grid_search() method.
  
  The grid ops structure is no longer created, rather the grid is directly 
created to be passed to the
  grid search algorithm.  The __grid_row() method has been added to create 
the row of the grid
  corresponding to a certain parameter.
........
  r9549 | bugman | 2009-09-21 19:37:50 +0200 (Mon, 21 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Implemented the acos grid search for angular parameters of the frame order 
theories.

  Fixed the call to the grid search.
........
  r9551 | bugman | 2009-09-21 20:25:52 +0200 (Mon, 21 Sep 2009) | 5 lines
  
  Fix for the __unpack_opt_results() for the new direct calling of the grid 
search.
  
  The returned results are different.
........
  r9552 | bugman | 2009-09-22 11:50:31 +0200 (Tue, 22 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Added a false, deliberately broken Xplor line to test the parsing of Xplor 
NOE files.
........
  r9553 | bugman | 2009-09-22 12:04:37 +0200 (Tue, 22 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Bug fix for the reading of Xplor NOE data when a line starts with '#'.
........
  r9554 | bugman | 2009-09-22 13:15:40 +0200 (Tue, 22 Sep 2009) | 5 lines
  
  Fix for the test_opt_rigid_rand_rot() system test.
  
  The changes to the frame order grid search broke this test.
........
  r9555 | bugman | 2009-09-22 14:28:03 +0200 (Tue, 22 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Added a series of checks to the test_curve_fitting() system test.
........
  r9556 | bugman | 2009-09-22 14:29:24 +0200 (Tue, 22 Sep 2009) | 3 lines

  Redesigned the N-state model grid search setup around the new minfx 
interface.
........
  r9559 | bugman | 2009-09-22 15:00:03 +0200 (Tue, 22 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Added a comment line.
........
  r9560 | bugman | 2009-09-22 15:00:25 +0200 (Tue, 22 Sep 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Another clean out of the grid search setup.
........
  r9561 | bugman | 2009-09-22 15:16:24 +0200 (Tue, 22 Sep 2009) | 3 lines

  Modified the grid search calls due to changes in minfx.
........
  r9564 | bugman | 2009-10-05 10:25:33 +0200 (Mon, 05 Oct 2009) | 10 lines
  
  Bug fix:  Added the function __deselect_spins() to remove spins with too 
little data.
  
  This fixes bug #14428 (<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://gna.org/bugs/?14428">http://gna.org/bugs/?14428</a>) reported by Pierre-Yves 
Savard &lt;pierre-yves dott
  savard at bcm dot ulaval dot ca&gt;.
  
  The new function is almost identical to that used in the model-free 
analysis performed by relax in
  that spins with no or too little data, or those which would be over-fit are 
removed from the
  analysis.
........
  r9565 | bugman | 2009-10-05 10:26:24 +0200 (Mon, 05 Oct 2009) | 3 lines

  Added the spin_id_col arg to the rdc.read() user function.
  
  This allows 2 different formats for spin identification - spin ID string or 
mol name, res name and
  num, and spin name and num.
........
  r9569 | bugman | 2009-10-06 11:25:10 +0200 (Tue, 06 Oct 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Removed some empty lines.
........
  r9570 | bugman | 2009-10-06 11:38:20 +0200 (Tue, 06 Oct 2009) | 9 lines
  
  Changes to the pcs.read() and rdc.read() user function interfaces.
  
  Columns are now numbered from 1 - note this will break many things!  The 
spin_id_col is now accepted
  and the spin_id arg is explained.
  
  The docstrings have also been modified all over these user function classes 
to replace
  'identification string' with 'ID string'.
........
  r9571 | bugman | 2009-10-06 11:39:22 +0200 (Tue, 06 Oct 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Fixed the call from the prompt to the generic fns.

  Created the read_spin_data_file() generator function.
  
  This is designed to replace quite a few inconsistent functions throughout 
the generic function code
  base.  It reads a columnar formatted file with a spin per line.
........
  r9573 | bugman | 2009-10-06 12:20:20 +0200 (Tue, 06 Oct 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Modified generate_spin_id_data_array() so that column numbering starts at 1.

........
  r9578 | bugman | 2009-10-06 13:01:06 +0200 (Tue, 06 Oct 2009) | 5 lines
  
  Converted value.read() to use the new relax_io.read_spin_data_file() 
function.
  
  This converts the user function to the 1.3 line design as well.
........
  r9579 | bugman | 2009-10-06 13:19:44 +0200 (Tue, 06 Oct 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Docstring modification better explaining spin_id.
........
  r9580 | bugman | 2009-10-06 13:20:57 +0200 (Tue, 06 Oct 2009) | 5 lines
  
  Converted spectrum.read_intensities() to use the new 
relax_io.read_spin_data_file() function.

  Bug fix for the relax_io.read_spin_data_file() function.
  
  The column number check was incorrect due to the column renumbering.
........
  r9583 | bugman | 2009-10-06 15:46:25 +0200 (Tue, 06 Oct 2009) | 6 lines
  
  The relax_io.read_spin_data_file() function now calls 
generic_fns.sequence.validate_sequence().
  
  This is a more advanced check of the sequence information.  The 
validate_sequence() function has
  also been modified to handle single data lines.
........
  r9584 | bugman | 2009-10-06 16:07:58 +0200 (Tue, 06 Oct 2009) | 3 lines

........
  r9596 | bugman | 2009-10-06 18:36:04 +0200 (Tue, 06 Oct 2009) | 3 lines
  
  Yet another fix for the new read_spin_data_file() function - hopefully this 
will be the last!

  Wrote the relax_io.write_spin_data_file() function.
  
  This writes spin specific data to a file (can be STDOUT).  It will replace 
the write_header()
  and write_body() functions of generic_fns.sequence.

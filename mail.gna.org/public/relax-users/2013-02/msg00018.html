<pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi Edward,


thanks for your reply.

a lot of strange Rex = 0.0000 terms, the other models show Rex of around 
10^-18 (=nearly zero). Convergence is reached in 20-30 rounds for each 
diffusion model, no oscillations are visible.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Is this Rex in the results file or in the extracted version?  Note
that relax stores Rex internally as the field strength independent
value of:

sigma_ex = Rex / omega**2
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

I extract Rex with the following command, I guess this is then the already 
field-corrected value?
        &gt; value.write( param = 'rex', file = 'example/rex.txt')

I also forgot to mention, that while for the spherical and spheroid models 
convergence was reached pretty soon, the ellipsoidal calculations are still 
ongoing for two days now, but I can see that the parameter values are not 
really changing anymore, and chi^2 and AIC values do not converge but differ 
by only a factor of 10^10 from each other in the last ~20 rounds. I guess it 
is safe to pull the plug here? 

Will the &quot;final&quot; run of relax still be able to see the final optimization 
results?

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Also note that
currently in all model-free software, Rex is assumed to be fast and
hence scales quadratically with field strength - this might be another
source of problems for your analysis.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

You mean, because my Rex is too slow or because I have too few fields 
available (600 &amp; 750 MHz)?

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">R1 temperature compensation is generally not needed as it is quite a
cold experiment, hence will almost always match the normal
spectrometer calibration.  
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

No, what I meant is off-resonance &quot;heating pulses&quot; that make my R1 experiment 
just as warm as the R2 experiment which heats the sample due to the CPMG 
train in the relaxation period. In practice I just irradiate for ~100 ms 
(which is the mean of the delay times I have during my R2 experiments) before 
the actual pulse sequence begins, i.e. during d0. 

Single-scan interleaved is standardly employed, of course. This is true for 
all our experiments: R1, R2, NOE.

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Everything else seems fine.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Hey, that's something! At least the procedure as such seems ok. 

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Relaxation dispersion might be interesting, but from what you describe
I don't think dispersion data will tell you much other than what you
already see with weak peaks.  Actually, as your system is 45 kDa, I
would not expect that you would see much dispersion at all - your weak
peaks are due to protein size and not Rex.  
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

I don't get that – certainly the protein size is determining signal intensity 
but Rex is an additional factor, right? And I have 4 highly similar complexes 
– two different proteins which are mutated at one position which each bind 
two identical peptides. X-ray crystal data show virtually identical 
structures. Chemical shifts are also mostly very, very similar, but – with 
everything else totally the same – strips of signals go missing in one set of 
the complexes, and *not* the other. 

So there are definitely differences between highly similar complexes, which 
is breathtakingly interesting (and which no-one showed before with 
experimental data), but what I reached out for is to quantify these 
differences. S2 or Rex values from mf analysis seemed like a good bet ;)

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">As for a guide about
relaxation dispersion, I know no equivalent to Seb's guide. [...] If you do 
find something, I'd be interested to have the
reference.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

I asked around at Researchgate and got a few reviews by Loria and Palmer. I 
feel that the Kay papers usually are so leading edge, they do not cover the 
basics and all the practical stuff. The other papers look promising 
(especially 1 and 4) but I didn't have the time to look at yet. Here they are:

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Maybe this relates to model m9 in relax.  Sometimes the very weak
peaks, broadened by chemical exchange, are too noisy to extract
model-free motions from.  This is visible in relax as the selection of
model m9.  In such a case, model m0 will probably not be picked.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

I excluded the really noisy/weak peaks beforehand and m9 gets picked 
sometimes (9 times m9 opposed to 62 times m0 out of ~220 picked signals).
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

How many did you exclude?  There is no need to exclude such peaks as
the protocol I developed will handle this.  
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

I excluded 6 where the peaks have been so weak that it was essentially only 
noise and a fit should give something close to a straight line.

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">I don't know if this is completely relevant to your question, but
noise is another issue which affects the reliability of the te
parameters.  As te increases, so does the errors.  [...]
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

So do you think if my data are too noisy this could be a consequence? I 
already reached the limit in terms of scans, protein concentration and 
measuring time. Maybe I should write a grant for two new magnets ...
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

For the spins where m0 are selected, do their errors look larger than
the other spins?  
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

I wouldn't say so:
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4019316/boxplot.error.pdf">https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4019316/boxplot.error.pdf</a>

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Or if you plot the I0 values from the relaxation
exponential curve-fitting, are these residues much lower than the
rest?  
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

There definitely seems to be a tendency:
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4019316/boxplot.pdf">https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4019316/boxplot.pdf</a>

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Maybe you could try out reduced spectral density mapping (very
easy in relax) and compare errors for the J(w) values.  
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

I will try that in the following days. 

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">As for new spectrometers, having more data would certainly help.  
Especially if you have this mixed diffusion tensor problem and have derived 
a
solution to test - then having data at 3 or 4 fields would be
incredibly powerful.  Maybe you should get your boss to talk to
Griesinger ;)  But if you have data at two field strengths, that
should be sufficient.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Ha, we even would have 4 fields at hand around Berlin: We have a a bunch of 
600MHz magnets, but also an 750MHz and a 900 MHz field, and the Free 
University would have a 800 MHz field. Not all of them are capable of 
recording single-scan interleaved pseudo-3D spectra, and that's where the 
problems are starting already ... So if anyone should be interested to devote 
his life to this question, Berlin might be not the worst place to start 
working on it ;)

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">[HetNOE, deuterated 45 KDa protein]
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">Oh, it's deuterated.  Ok, then you'll need much more time.  Though as
it is 45 kDa, the relaxation should be nevertheless relatively fast.
You can quite easily test this if you are curious.  You can simply
compare 1D versions of your 2D experiments.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Should be interesting to see. It's always nice to save a bit measuring time – 
I need a lot of scans due to the insensitive experiment, a lot of points in 
the indirect dimension due to overlap and a lot of d0 time due to 
deuteration. One sample sits in the spectrometer for almost an entire week to 
get decent HetNOE data. And then I need a second field. And then I two 
different proteins, two ligands and the protein complex is a trimer, with 
each component labeled individually (twelve differently labeled sample 
types). That means I need many weeks  measuring time only for all HetNOE data 
if I decide to measure absolutely every component from the beginning to the 
end ... shaving a bit off isn't probably the worst idea.

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Actually, the 45 kDa size could be the reason for the m0 model being
selected.  It could simply be too big, the relaxation from tumbling
could be so fast that the internal motions have been hidden in the
data.  
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

So if I see differences between samples that should still mean something. One 
protein behaves properly, the other doesn't – there is something going on.

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">I can only recommend switching to Sparky for this type of analysis.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

The main reason for not using sparky was that it cannot read Bruker pseudo 3D 
data and converting the individual planes from all the different data sets 
without mixing up the different delay times I tried is a incredible pain. 
Also, I'd have duplicate data where I could easily mix up file names and lose 
information where a specific set of data originally came from. Additionally, 
there is the assignment that has been done in CCPN, and which has to be 
exported into Sparky. I hope that it is possible, I guess I have to write and 
read and validate shift lists.

*But* I will give it a try. It seems like CCPN can't help me here.

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Sorry for the long sermon. I appreciate that you always read my stuff and 
also answer in a really helpful and extensive manner.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Well, I hope some of my long answers helped.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

They do!

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;"> If I was you, I would
first redo the relaxation analysis using Sparky (and relax to fit the
exponentials) and compare the data to CCPN.  
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

That's the first thing I'll try. 

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Then if m0 is still
present, consider if you should blame it on the size of your system
hiding data (more field strengths should then help uncover the
dynamics).  
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Too bad the console for our 900MHz magnet is so old. I'd have to measure 
non-interleaved spectra, which is probably as good as just not doing it at 
all.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">As you are working with complexes, then maybe an issue is that a
single diffusion tensor is not an adequate representation of the
system, resulting in the model m0 appearing more than it should.  This
might be the case if the complex is not tight and you have a mixture
of complex and free monomers.  [...]
Finally, you should consider if your complex is tight or
not.  If you think it is not [...]
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

I think it is a pretty tight complex. If one of the components leaves the 
heterotrimer, it falls apart, and the &quot;primary&quot; subunit unfolds and 
precipitates. But the other component (which I did not look at yet) is still 
soluble, which could cause trouble as soon as I start recording data for it 
...

Regarding solving a maybe unsolvable statistical / applied physics / 
mathematical problem: I'm not sure if I'm the right person to go after it, 
I'd need somebody with better stat / physics / math skills ;)

Martin

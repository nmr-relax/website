<pre style="margin: 0em;">This is a major feature and bugfix release.  A comprehensive tutorial
has been added to the relaxation dispersion chapter of the manual
which shows, step-by-step, the dispersion analysis in the GUI using
screenshots.  Other changes include improved PDB chain ID support, a
new mode for running a relax script and then entering the prompt UI
mode, multiple file reading by the spectrum.read_intensities user
function, and improvements to the relaxation dispersion analysis.  A
number of major bugs in the dispersion analysis concerning different
relaxation delay times for different experiments and for improved
handling of the offset have also been fixed.  A number of important
GUI bugs have also been fixed.  All users are recommended to upgrade
to this version of relax.

The new relax versions can be downloaded from
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nmr-relax.com/download.html">http://www.nmr-relax.com/download.html</a>.  If binary distributions are
not yet available for your platform and you manage to compile the
binary modules, please consider contributing these to the relax
project (described in section 3.6 of the relax manual,
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/relax_distribution_archives.html">http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/relax_distribution_archives.html</a>).

The full list of changes is:

    Features:
        * Full support for PDB chain IDs in the internal structural object.
        * Improvements for the devel_scripts/python_seek.py for
finding all installed Python versions and modules.  Individual modules
can now be specified on the command line.
        * The pedantic command line option -p, --pedantic has been
renamed to -e, --escalate.
        * The new prompt command line option -p, --prompt causes the
relax prompt mode to launch after running a script to allow relax to
be inspected interactively.
        * Better organisation of the relax command line options into
groups, as shown by running 'relax -h'.
        * A tutorial for using the relaxation dispersion analysis in
the GUI has been added to the manual.  This includes step-by-step
instructions with many screenshots.
        * Improvements to the manual including better and consistent
line breaking for the GUI menu item text, user functions, file and
directory paths, and Python module paths.
        * The spectrum.read_intensities user function can now load
multiple files simultaneously, allowing for simplified use in the GUI.
        * Addition of a new GUI window element for loading multiple files.
        * Improvements to the sequence data input GUI window including
the item count being displayed and a 'Delete' button to remove the
last element.
        * Improvement for the relaxation dispersion auto-analysis -
the names of the automatically created data pipes are now unique by
appending the name of the data pipe bundle to the end.  This allows
multiple dispersion auto-analyses to exist simultaneously in the GUI
or within one relax state file.
        * The relaxation dispersion analysis now handles deselected spins.
        * Improved colour coding of relax log messages in the relax manual.
        * The relaxation dispersion auto-analysis now creates the
chi2.out text file.  This is for more easily comparing the chi-squared
values between analyses.


    Changes:
        * Converted the chain ID list in the internal structural
object to the CHAIN_ID_LIST module variable.
        * The internal structure object method
_pdb_chain_id_to_mol_index() now uses the CHAIN_ID_LIST string.  This
allows for the full PDB chain ID range to be supported.
        * Small improvement for the devel_scripts/python_seek.py
script.  The list of detected Python binaries files are now sorted
prior to determining the installed modules.
        * Updated the N_state_model.5_state_xz system test to allow it
to complete on i586 Linux systems.  The optimisation would continue
for a huge amount of time on a test system (Mageia 4 i586 VM) and
would make it appear as though the test suite has hung.  By limiting
the maximum number of iterations in the optimisation to 1000, the test
will complete successfully and the parameters optimised to the same
precision.
        * Loosened the checks for the
Frame_order.test_korzhnev_2005_15n_zq_data system test.  This is to
allow the test to pass on a 32-bit test system (Mageia 4 i586 VM).
        * Decreased the accuracy of the
Relax_disp.test_korzhnev_2005_15n_dq_data system test.  This is to
allow the test to pass on a 32-bit test system (Mageia 4 i586 VM).
        * Decreased the precision of the
Relax_disp.test_hansen_cpmg_data_auto_analysis system test.  This is
to allow the test to pass on a 32-bit test system using Python 2.5 and
Python 3.1 (Mageia 4i586 VM).
        * Decreased the precision of the
Relax_disp.test_hansen_cpmg_data_auto_analysis_r2eff system test.
This is to allow the test to pass on a 32-bit test system using Python
2.5 and Python 3.1 (Mageia 4i586 VM).
        * Decreased the precision of the
Relax_disp.test_hansen_cpmg_data_to_cr72 system test.  This is to
allow the test to pass on a 32-bit test system using Python 2.5 and
Python 3.1 (Mageia 4i586 VM).
        * Fix for the
test_suite/system_tests/scripts/noe/bug_21562_noe_replicate_fail.py
system test script.  There was some invisible binary junk at the start
of the file which as causing the Noe.test_bug_21562_noe_replicate_fail
system test to fail, as the script could not load.  This was only
affecting one 32-bit test system using Python 3.1 and Python 3.2
(Mageia 4 i586 VM).
        * Fixes for the unit tests of the package __all__ lists for
Python 3.  When Python 3 generates byte-compiled *.pyc files, these
are stored in __pycache__ directories.  These directories are now
skipped for the package content unit tests, allowing the test to pass.
        * Loosened the checks of some of the Relax_fit system tests.
These are the Relax_fit.test_curve_fitting_height and
Relax_fit.test_curve_fitting_volume system tests.  The minor change is
required to allow the tests to pass on a 32-bit system with Python
3.3.3.
        * The python_seek.py development script now allows the modules
to be specified on the command line.  This speeds up the script and
allows individual modules to be checked and the version displayed.
        * Added a copyright notice to the python_seek.py script.  The
descriptive text has also been converted into a docstring.  The
copyright is simply to show who wrote the script and how old it is.
        * The python_seek.py script can now check for the ancient
Numeric module.
        * The python_seek.py script can now check for the ancient
Scientific module.
        * The python_seek.py now lists the Python version again
(broken in the last few commits).
        * The python_seek.py script now accepts the 'all' argument to
display all modules supported by the script.
        * Output formatting improvements for the python_seek.py
development script.
        * Changed the module ordering in the python_seek.py development 
script.
        * Epydoc docstring fix for the
pipe_control.structure.main.load_spins() function.
        * Created the Mf.test_bug_21615_incomplete_setup_failure GUI
tests.  This is designed to catch bug #21615
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21615">https://gna.org/bugs/?21615</a>) as reported by Ivan Leung (ivanhoe dott
leung att chem dott ox dot ac dot uk).  Included are the data files
Ivan attached to the bug report truncated to two residues.  The GUI
test follows exactly the steps outlined by Ivan.
        * Deleted the ancient, unused 'quit' argument of the relax
interpreter object.  This code was identified in a post by Troels
Linnet at 
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.devel/5000/focus=5003">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.devel/5000/focus=5003</a>.
 This argument never worked correctly and has not been used for many,
many years.  Many code paths in relax needed to be updated to remove
the argument.
        * Shifted the pedantic flag to escalate flag. The option -p
would insted be used for the option --prompt.  Fix for sr #3117,
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/support/?3117">https://gna.org/support/?3117</a>) - Functionality to inspect
interactively after running script - The equivalence to python -i.
        * Added the -p --prompt option for running a relax script and
inspect interactively.  Fix for sr #3117,
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/support/?3117">https://gna.org/support/?3117</a>) - Functionality to inspect
interactively after running script - The equivalence to python -i.
        * Modified the help text to explain that -p will launch relax
in prompt mode after running any optionally supplied scripts.  Fix for
sr #3117, (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/support/?3117">https://gna.org/support/?3117</a>) - Functionality to inspect
interactively after running script - The equivalence to python -i.
This is to allow the -p --prompt option to be given without a script.
relax should support this so that a user doesn't get too confused when
trying to start in prompt mode with the --prompt flag and support the
--prompt argument without a script being supplied.
        * Finished implementing the functionality of interacting with
variables after executing a script.  Fix for sr #3117,
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/support/?3117">https://gna.org/support/?3117</a>) - Functionality to inspect
interactively after running script - The equivalence to python -i.
For getting access to variables after executing a script, the variable
should be saved under: cdp.X, where X define a container.  The name
space issue is discussed in:
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.devel/5012">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.devel/5012</a>.
        * Organisation of the relax command line options into distinct
groups.  This follows from the message at
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.devel/5024">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.devel/5024</a>.  The
optparse.OptionGroup object is now used to cluster the arguments.
This cleans up the output of 'relax -h' and explains the options to
the user in a clearer way.
        * Fix for the user function intro flag.  Fix for sr #3117,
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/support/?3117">https://gna.org/support/?3117</a>) - Functionality to inspect
interactively after running script - The equivalence to python -i.  It
should be turned on for the script so you see the &quot;relax&gt;&quot; messages,
and then turned off again for the prompt so that the user function
text and &quot;relax&gt;&quot; is not printed out twice.
        * Updated the copyright statement shown in the GUI for 2014.
        * Save state added for bug #21665.  Regarding bug #21665,
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21665">https://gna.org/bugs/?21665</a>) - Running a CPMG analysis with two
fields at two delay times.
        * Added system test to catch bug: relax -s
Relax_disp.test_bug_21665_cpmg_two_fields_two_delaytimes_fail.
Regarding bug #21665, (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21665">https://gna.org/bugs/?21665</a>) - Running a CPMG
analysis with two fields at two delay times.
        * Added a system test for using both calc() and a system test
for relax_disp auto analysis.  Regarding bug #21665,
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21665">https://gna.org/bugs/?21665</a>) - Running a CPMG analysis with two
fields at two delay times.
        * Added some initial screenshots of the dispersion GUI
analysis.  These will be used to create a tutorial for using the
relaxation dispersion analysis in the GUI to be added to the
dispersion chapter of the relax manual.
        * Started to create the tutorial in the manual for using the
dispersion GUI.  This is at the end of the relaxation dispersion
chapter of the manual and covers the basic setup of spin systems.  It
includes the recently added screenshots.
        * Improvement to the formatting of the GUI menu item text in
the manual.  The text can now have a line break between the items,
just after the arrows.  This significantly improves the paragraph
layout in the manual.
        * Created two new LaTeX commands for improving the layout of
the relax manual.  These are \ossep and \osus which will be used to
format the file and directory separator character and the underscore
character respectively.  They will be used in the \file{} and
\directory{}commands to add the '/\linebreak[0]' and '\_\linebreak[0]'
text to allow for better line breaking.
        * Converted all LaTeX files of the manual to use the new
\ossep and \osus commands.  This will result in better formatting of
the manual by making the linebreaking after '/' and '_'characters
consistent and universal.
        * Created two new LaTeX commands for improving the layout of
user functions in the relax manual.  These are \ufsep and \ufus which
will be used to format the user function separator character and the
underscore character respectively.  They are used in the \uf{}
commands to add the '.\linebreak[0]' and '\_\linebreak[0]' text to
allow for improved and consistent line breaking.
        * Added the unit test infrastructure for testing the
specific_analyses.relax_disp package.  This currently includes the
package __all__ list unit test.
        * Updated the specific_analyses.relax_disp package __all__
list.  This was identified in the previously committed unit test.
        * Added the infrastructure for the unit tests of the
specific_analyses.relax_disp.disp_data module.  This is in response to
the post <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.scm/19963/focus=5046">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.scm/19963/focus=5046</a>
by Troels, and is described in my response at
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.scm/19963/focus=5048">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.scm/19963/focus=5048</a>.
        * Created two new LaTeX commands for improving the layout of
Python code in the relax manual.  These are \pysep and \pyus which
will be used to format the Python module separator character and the
Python underscore character respectively.  They are used in the
\module{}, \pycode{}, etc.  commands to add the '.\linebreak[0]' and
'\_\linebreak[0]' text to allow for improved and consistent line
breaking.
        * Complete reformatting of the base LaTeX files.  The
paragraph structure has been changed so that each sentence now starts
on a new line.  This is for better tracking of changes (via 'svn diff'
for example), for better searchability of certain text elements using
command line tools such as 'grep', and for easier easier use of the
'sed' tool.  The change tracking is most important as it allows for
finer granularity - a small change will now only be shown as a change
in one sentence rather than the whole paragraph, allowing the change
to be identified more easily.  It also allows for easier commit
maintenance.
        * Reformatting of all of the LaTeX code for the figures in the
relax manual.  The aim is to have as many parts as possible on
separate lines to allow for better control of changes in the
subversion repository and for improved usage of command line tools.
        * Reformatting of all of the LaTeX code for the itemize and
description lists in the relax manual.  This is to regularise the
LaTeX code throughout the *.tex files of the manual.  All items are
now indented for easier viewing.  And leading empty lines before the
lists have all been removed.
        * The docstring fetching script for the manual now creates
lists in the new, cleaner format.
        * Implemented unit test for catching the correct return of
loop_exp_frq_offset_point_time.  Regarding bug #21665,
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21665">https://gna.org/bugs/?21665</a>) - Running a CPMG analysis with two
fields at two delay times.
        * Grammar corrections - changed the 'eg.' abbreviation to
'e.g.' in a couple of places.
        * Modified the unit test name for testing the correct return
of the relaxation time periods.  Regarding bug #21665,
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21665">https://gna.org/bugs/?21665</a>) - Running a CPMG analysis with two
fields at two delay times.
        * Added more to the dispersion GUI analysis tutorial.  This
includes a screenshot showing the use of the 'Spin isotope' button in
the GUI.  Descriptions for all five 'metadata' buttons have been added
as well.
        * Expanded the relaxation dispersion GUI tutorial in the
manual.  This now includes the first steps for loading the peak
intensity data.
        * Added the The relaxation time period to be used when
returning cpmg frqs.  Regarding bug #21665,
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21665">https://gna.org/bugs/?21665</a>) - Running a CPMG analysis with two
fields at two delay times.
        * Added test for skipping non-matching time points.  Regarding
bug #21665, (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21665">https://gna.org/bugs/?21665</a>) - Running a CPMG analysis
with two fields at two delay times.
        * Added the time point to be sent into the return function of
cpmg frequencies.  Regarding bug #21665, (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21665">https://gna.org/bugs/?21665</a>)
- Running a CPMG analysis with two fields at two delay times.
        * Improved unit test for cathing both time and dispersion
point when looping over experiment and time points.  Regarding bug
#21665, (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21665">https://gna.org/bugs/?21665</a>) - Running a CPMG analysis with
two fields at two delay times.
        * Modified the spectrum.read_intensities user function
frontend to load multiple files.  This follows from the thread
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.devel/5057/focus=5062">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.devel/5057/focus=5062</a>.
        * Implemented the GUI element for loading multiple files.
This follows from the thread
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.devel/5057/focus=5062">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.devel/5057/focus=5062</a>.
 This is via the new user function argument type &quot;file sel multi&quot;, now
used by the spectrum.read_intensities user function.  The file
selection element consists of two parts.  The GUI element embedded in
the user function wizard page is similar to the &quot;file sel&quot; element,
except that the preview button is not present.  The file selection
button behaviour is also different in that it launches the new
multiple file selection window.  The multiple file selection window is
based on the 'sequence' data window, as used in the spectrum ID
argument for the spectrum.read_intensities user function.  However the
ListCtrl element has been replaced by a custom scrolled panel.  The
'Add' button adds a new file selection GUI element consisting of a
TextCtrl for displaying and manual editing of the file name, the file
selection button for launching the relax file selection dialog, and
the preview button lost in the parent GUI element.   The scrolled
panel allows more elements in the panel than can fit in the window.
The 'Delete all' and 'OK' buttons from the 'sequence' data window are
also present and function as expected.
        * Modification of the new multiple file selection GUI element.
 The multiple file selection window now shows the index (plus one) of
each file selection element at the front of that element.  This way
the user can easily see how many file elements there are and can match
file names to numbers.  This will help in making sure that the file
names and spectrum ID elements correspond to each other.
        * Added a 'Delete' button to the new multiple file selection
GUI window.  This simply deletes the last item in the list.  This will
be useful if the user clicks on the 'Add' button too many times -
instead of clicking 'Delete all' and having to re-select all files,
now the last element can be removed.
        * Improved the behaviour of the multiple file selection GUI
window.  The RelaxFileDialog GUI element is now initialised when the
file selection button is clicked rather than in the __init__() method.
 The result of this change is that the current working directory is
dynamically changed in the RelaxFileDialog, hence if the directory is
changed in one file selection element, it will look like it is changed
in all.
        * Renamed the test_loop_exp_time() dispersion unit test to
test_loop_exp_frq_offset_point_time().  This is for the
specific_analyses.relax_disp.disp_data.Test_disp_data.test_loop_exp_frq_offset_point_time()
unit test.  The name better reflects the function being tested.
        * Created the test_loop_exp_frq() dispersion unit test.  This
checks the operation of the loop_exp_frq() function from the module
specific_analyses.relax_disp.disp_data.  It uses the data attached to
the bug report at <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21665">https://gna.org/bugs/?21665</a>.
        * Fixes for the unit tests of the spectrum.read_intensities
user function.  A number of checks were not correctly set up, and the
recent changes caused others to now fail.
        * Modified the GUI window for inputting sequence data to
include item numbers.  An non-editable initial column with the number
of each item has been added.  This is to help the user when, for
example, the items of one sequence element should match another (for
example in the spectrum.read_intensities user function where multiple
file names should match multiple spectrum IDs).
        * Added a 'Delete' button to the sequence input GUI window.
This is to match the multiple file selection GUI window.  The button
allows the user to delete the last item from the list.  So if 'Add'
has been clicked too many times, the user does not have to start again
from scratch by clicking on 'Delete all'.
        * More modifications to the sequence input GUI window to match
the multiple file selection element.  The window now starts with a
single element rather than nothing.
        * Continued expanding the tutorial for performing a relaxation
dispersion analysis in the GUI.  This is for the dispersion chapter of
the manual.
        * Created the Peak_lists.test_read_peak_list_sparky_double
system test.  This is used to test the loading of multiple files
simultaneously by the spectrum.read_intensities user function.
        * Expanded the Peak_lists.test_read_peak_list_sparky_double
system test to check all intensities.  This now checks all of the peak
heights read by the spectrum.read_intensities user function.
        * Expanded the capabilities of the spectrum.read_intensities
user function.  Now multiple files can be loaded simultaneously.
        * Fix for the multiple file selection GUI element.  The GUI
element now returns single values rather than lists from the
GetValue() function when only a single file is selected.  This allows
the spectrum.read_intensities user function to operate normally again
in the GUI.
        * Minor fix for the
Relax_disp.test_bug_21076_multi_col_peak_list system test.  The
spectrum ID argument ['auto'] has been changed to the single value of
'auto'.  This argument should not be a list.
        * Expansion of the tutorial for running the relaxation
dispersion analysis in the GUI.  The tutorial is now close to
complete.  The peak intensity loading wizard section is complete as
well the model selection window and optimisation settings sections and
the relax execution.
        * More additions for the tutorial on using the dispersion
analysis in the GUI.  This is for the relaxation dispersion chapter of
the manual.  The tutorial is almost complete with descriptions and
screenshots for completing the non-clustered analysis and conducting
the clustered analysis all the way to execution.
        * Created the State.test_bug_21716_no_cdp_state_save system
test.  This is for catching bug #21716 (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21716">https://gna.org/bugs/?21716</a>),
the failure to save the relax state just after deleting the current
data pipe, even if other data pipes exist.
        * Created the
General.test_bug_21720_pipe_switching_with_tab_closure GUI test.  This
is to catch bug #21720 (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21720">https://gna.org/bugs/?21720</a>), the failure to
set the current data pipe in the GUI when the current and non-last
analysis tab is closed.  The test replicates the steps as outlined in
the bug report.
        * Added unit test for looping over: exp frq offset point.
Regarding bug #21665, (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21665">https://gna.org/bugs/?21665</a>) - Running a CPMG
analysis with two fields at two delay times.  This follows

        * Added unit test for looping over: exp frq offset point.
Regarding bug #21665, (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21665">https://gna.org/bugs/?21665</a>) - Running a CPMG

<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.devel/5070">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.devel/5070</a>.
        * Changes for the relaxation dispersion auto-analysis.  The
final data pipe name now includes the data pipe bundle name.  This is
so the pipe name is unique, allowing multiple analyses to be executed
in one relax state.
        * Fixes for all of the Relax_disp system tests for the changes
to the dispersion auto-analysis.  The automatically created pipe names
now include the pipe bundle name to make them unique, so the system
tests have been updated to match this behaviour.
        * Increased the grid search size in the r1rho_on_res_m61.py
dispersion system test script.  This is to allow the
Relax_disp.test_m61_exp_data_to_m61 system test to pass more often.
The increase does not cause a large increase in computation time as
less time is spent in the optimisation and Monte Carlo simulation
steps.
        * Renamed unit test, to follow previous namings of unit tests.
 Regarding bug #21665, (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21665">https://gna.org/bugs/?21665</a>) - Running a CPMG
analysis with two fields at two delay times.
        * Fix for the relaxation dispersion auto-analysis to improve
its behaviour in the test suite.  The problem is that the
auto-analysis acquires the execution lock (status.exec_lock) but if
the analysis cannot complete due to a bug, the lock is never released.
 This causes nasty problems for many subsequent tests, resulting in a
cascade of test failures.  This is especially problematic in the GUI
tests where the execution lock controls many aspects of the interface.
 The solution was simply to run the auto-analysis run() method within
a try-finally statement.  The release of the lock occurs in the
'finally' clause, guaranteeing its release.
        * Improvement for GUI test base tearDown() clean up method.  A
wx.Yield() call has been added to allow all GUI operations after a
relax reset to complete prior to the next test starting.  This should
avoid certain racing conditions which can cause a cascade of tests to
fail.
        * Added unit test for looping over: exp, frq, offset, point,
time.  Regarding bug #21665, (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21665">https://gna.org/bugs/?21665</a>) - Running a
CPMG analysis with two fields at two delay times.  This unit test will
fail, since the last loop over the time points has a weak assumption
just to loop over all time points, instead of checking for existence
of such time point.  This unit test follows recommendation in thread:

        * More fixes for the relaxation dispersion auto-analysis for
the pipe names now including the bundle name.
        * Added some missing RelaxError imports to the dispersion 
auto-analysis.
        * Created the Relax_disp.test_bug_21715_clustered_indexerror
system test.  This is to catch bug #21715
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21715">https://gna.org/bugs/?21715</a>), the failure of the relaxation
dispersion auto-analysis when running a clustered analysis due to an
IndexError during minimisation.
        * Modified unit test to pass.  Regarding bug #21665,
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21665">https://gna.org/bugs/?21665</a>) - Running a CPMG analysis with two

purposes to test the restriction of the looping.
        * Replacing looping over time points from cdp.relax_time_list
to loop_time(frq=frq).  Regarding bug #21665,
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21665">https://gna.org/bugs/?21665</a>) - Running a CPMG analysis with two
fields at two delay times.  loop_time has been modified to accept
spectrometer frequency as input to restrict the looping.
        * Complete support for deselected spins has been added to the
relaxation dispersion analysis.  This fixes bug #21715
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21715">https://gna.org/bugs/?21715</a>), the failure of the relaxation
dispersion auto-analysis when running a clustered analysis due to an

        * Added exp_type, frq, offset, point to the loop_time()
function.  Regarding bug #21665, (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21665">https://gna.org/bugs/?21665</a>) -
Running a CPMG analysis with two fields at two delay times.
Implemented as suggested in:
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mail-archive.com/relax-devel@xxxxxxx/msg04993.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/relax-devel@xxxxxxx/msg04993.html</a>.  In all
these cases, that information is available, so it should be used.  If
one are analysing a combination of data types simultaneously (SQ CPMG,
DQ CPMG, R1rho), one will not have the same relaxation time for each.
For different spin-lock or 180 degree pulse offsets and even different
dispersion points, the time may also be different.
        * Made count_relax_times() take optional arguments as:
exp_type, frq, offset, point.  Regarding bug #21665,
(<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21665">https://gna.org/bugs/?21665</a>) - Running a CPMG analysis with two

        * The fetch_docstrings.py script now creates a new LaTeX
listing language for relax log messages.  This is in the
script_definitions() method which creates the script_definition.tex
file.  The idea is to avoid colouring relax/Python keywords such as
'as', 'from', etc. in the log messages.
        * Moved the unit test get_times() to its own test.  Regarding

        * Completed the tutorial for using the dispersion analysis in
the GUI.  This is for the relaxation dispersion chapter of the manual.
        * Some edits for the tutorial on using the dispersion GUI
analysis.  The results of the relax_disp.insignificance user function
are now shown to demonstrate what this does.
        * Fixes for some incorrectly reported results in the
dispersion GUI tutorial in the manual.  The non-clustered results had
been incorrectly copied from the log messages.
        * More incorrect value fixes for the dispersion GUI tutorial
in the manual.  The pA and kex values were also somehow incorrect.
        * Added system test for bug #21344.  Regarding bug #21344,

        * Editing of the dispersion GUI analysis tutorial in the
manual.  The whole section has been proofed and improved.
        * A concluding statement has been added to the dispersion GUI
analysis tutorial in the manual.
        * Added spacing in front of all lstlisting environments in the
relaxation dispersion chapter of the manual.
        * Spelling fix for the spectrometer frequency checks of the
spectrometer.frequency user function.
        * Spell checking of the entire relaxation dispersion chapter
of the manual.
        * Correction for some text in the dispersion chapter of the
manual.  The text 'are differentially defined' has been changed to
'are dually defined', as the word differentially was incorrect.
        * Fixes for the spacing after e.g. and i.e. in the relax
manual.  The character '\' needs to be used after the final dot to
indicate that this is not a sentence stop, hence the double spacing
normally used between sentences should not be used.

    Bugfixes:
        * Minor bugfix for the internal structural object add_model()
method.  The internal structural object was being called with self as
an argument, which would default to the chain_id keyword argument.
The result would be relax state files with multiple copies of the
internal structural object embedded in the structural XML section.
        * Fix for bug #21605, the failure of the
Frame_order.test_generate_rotor2_distribution system test.  The bug at
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://gna.org/bugs/?21605">http://gna.org/bugs/?21605</a> is due to the fact that numpy.float16 is
not defined on all systems.  Older numpy versions do not have this.
Therefore the float16 value is now imported from lib.check_types where
it is aliased to float32 when not defined.
        * Fix for bug #21615, the missing data dialog failure when
executing the GUI model-free analysis.  This is the bug at
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21615">https://gna.org/bugs/?21615</a> as reported by Ivan Leung (ivanhoe dott
leung att chem dott ox dot ac dot uk).  The problem is that the spin
container's &quot;isotope&quot; variable is being accessed directly after a test
showing that this variable does not exist.  This is now fixed so that
the missing data dialog is now presented explaining that the spin
isotope information is not set.
        * Fix for bug #21704, the failure of the GUI analyses when the
home directory '~' character is used.  The bug is located at
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21704">https://gna.org/bugs/?21704</a>.  The problem is located in many parts of
the program, and other problematic areas may still be present.  In all
cases where the directory or file is accessed, the
os.path.expanduser() function must be called.
        * Fix for bug #21716 (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21716">https://gna.org/bugs/?21716</a>).  This is
the failure to save the relax state just after deleting the current
data pipe, even if other data pipes exist.  The problem was that the
specific analysis functions data_names() and return_data_desc() were
being retrieved using the current data pipe rather than the actual
data pipe that the data structures belong to.  So if the current data
pipe is None, then these fail.  Now the data pipe type is being passed
through all of the to_xml() methods so that the correct data_names()
and return_data_desc()methods are retrieved.
        * Fix for bug #21720 (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21720">https://gna.org/bugs/?21720</a>).  This is
the faulty pipe switching behaviour when a non-last analysis tab is
deleted in the GUI.  Now the correct data pipe should be always
switched to when closing an analysis tab.
        * Fix for bug #21695 (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21695">https://gna.org/bugs/?21695</a>).  This is
the failure of the relaxation dispersion system tests on a 64-bit MS
Windows system due to lower precision of the platform.  Two of the
errors have already been found on a 64-bit Windows Vista virtual
machine and fixed.  The last test should now also pass.
        * Fix for bug #21665, (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?21665">https://gna.org/bugs/?21665</a>) - Running
a CPMG analysis with two fields at two delay times.
        * Fix for bug #21344, (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?21344">https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?21344</a>) -

  Modified the PCS content testing base system.
  
  The paramagnetic centre is now shifted to the origin, as this is the real 
centre of the PCS physics.

  Intermediate optimisation results are now stored by the frame order 
auto-analysis.
  
  The results from each minimise.grid_search and minimise.execute user 
function call are now stored in
  specially named directories located in the 'intermediate_results' 
directory, which itself is located
  in the auto-analysis results_dir directory.  This allows intermediate 
results to be more easily
  analysed later on, which can be useful for optimising the optimisation 
steps.  These directories can
  also be used for the pre_run_dir auto-analysis argument for subsequent 
refinements from earlier
  steps in the optimisation.  The results stored include everything from the 
results_output() method
  and the count_sobol_points() and summarise() functions.
  
  To allow this to work, the auto-analysis functions count_sobol_points() and 
summarise() required
  modification.  Results files are now always loaded into a temporary data 
pipe, rather switching to
  the corresponding pipe, and the temporary data pipe is deleted after the 
data has been extracted.
  The original data pipe name is also stored and a switch back to that pipe 
occurs at the end of each
  function.

  The simulation is now turned of for intermediate results in the frame order 
auto-analysis.
  
  The intermediate results are only for checking, so for these the full 
pseudo-Brownian dynamics
  simulations are not required.  The simulation flag has been introduced into 
the results_output()
  method of the auto-analysis to control this.

  The splitting of the rigid model grid search into rotation and translation 
parts is now optional.
  
  In the frame order auto-analysis, the rigid_grid_split argument has been 
introduced.  The
  alternating algorithm of performing a grid search over the rotational space 
followed by translation
  is now optional and turned off by default.  The reason is because the 
global minimum is sometimes
  missed with this shortcut algorithm.

  Speed up of the Frame_order.test_auto_analysis system test.
  
  The splitting of the rigid model grid search into rotation and translation 
parts has been
  reactivated.
........
  r26316 | bugman | 2014-10-20 15:11:58 +0200 (Mon, 20 Oct 2014) | 5 lines
  
  Created the Optimisation.has_grid() method for the frame order 
auto-analysis.
  
  This is used to test if the optimisation settings object has a grid search 
defined.
........
  r26317 | bugman | 2014-10-20 15:15:21 +0200 (Mon, 20 Oct 2014) | 7 lines
  
  The grid search can now be skipped for the rigid model in the frame order 
auto-analysis.
  
  If the input 3D structures are close to the real solution, the grid search 
over the translational
  and rotation parameters of the rigid model could be skipped.  This speeds 
up the analysis and can
  help find the real solution in problematic cases.

  r26318 | bugman | 2014-10-20 16:23:08 +0200 (Mon, 20 Oct 2014) | 6 lines
  
  The intermediate results storing can now be turned off in the frame order 
auto-analysis.
  
  The new store_intermediate Boolean argument has been added to the analysis 
to allow the storage of
  these results to be turned on or off.
........
  r26319 | bugman | 2014-10-20 16:24:11 +0200 (Mon, 20 Oct 2014) | 5 lines
  
  The intermediate results are no longer stored in the 
Frame_order.test_auto_analysis system test.
  
  This drops the test timing on one system from ~190 seconds to ~50 seconds.

  r26320 | bugman | 2014-10-20 16:45:49 +0200 (Mon, 20 Oct 2014) | 7 lines
  
  The compression level for results files can now be set in the frame order 
auto-analysis.
  
  This is via the new argument results_compress_type, which is used to set 
the compress_type argument
  of the results.write user function.  The results reading parts of the 
auto-analysis have been
  updated to allow uncompressed, bzip2 compressed, and gzip compressed files 
to be handled.
........
  r26349 | bugman | 2014-10-22 15:22:03 +0200 (Wed, 22 Oct 2014) | 7 lines
  
  Added a printout of the frame order model in the target function setup 
function.
  
  This is printed out when the minimise.calculate, minimise.grid_search, or 
minimise.execute user
  function are called, and is for better feedback, especially in the 
auto-analysis where the
  repetitive optimisations can be confusing.
........
  r26365 | bugman | 2014-10-23 11:34:29 +0200 (Thu, 23 Oct 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Updated the frame order analysis for the structure.load_spins user function 
changes.
  
  The minimise_setup_atomic_pos() function of the 
specific_analyses.frame_order.optimisation module
  now handles the mixed type spin.pos variable correctly.
........
  r26388 | bugman | 2014-10-23 15:32:59 +0200 (Thu, 23 Oct 2014) | 5 lines
  
  The data pipe containing a PCS subset is now optional in the frame order 
auto-analysis.
  
  This is for systems which have so little data that a subset makes no sense.
........
  r26389 | bugman | 2014-10-23 15:47:26 +0200 (Thu, 23 Oct 2014) | 3 lines
  
  Missing import.
........
  r26390 | bugman | 2014-10-23 15:57:02 +0200 (Thu, 23 Oct 2014) | 12 lines
  
  Redesigned the optimisation steps for the frame order auto-analysis.
  
  The code has been significantly simplified as the optimisation for the PCS 
subset and full data set
  was the same.  The code duplication has been eliminated by combining it 
into the new optimisation()
  method.  The check for the PCS subset has also been expanded so that it is 
skipped if the subset
  data pipe is not supplied, even if an optimisation object for the subset 
has been (this should
  prevent strange errors when the auto-analysis is incorrectly used).
  
  A side effect of this code merger is that the zooming grid search has now 
been activated for the
  full PCS data set.  This is of great benefit when a PCS subset is not being 
used.
........
  r26391 | bugman | 2014-10-23 16:19:39 +0200 (Thu, 23 Oct 2014) | 6 lines
  
  The minimise.execute user function skip_preset flag is now False in the 
frame order auto-analysis.
  
  This is for the main model optimisation.  Without this flag set, the grid 
search for the pivot point
  position for the rotor model was being skipped at the first zoom level.
........
  r26392 | bugman | 2014-10-23 16:32:15 +0200 (Thu, 23 Oct 2014) | 9 lines
  
  The pivot point can now be excluded from the grid search in the frame order 
auto-analysis.
  
  If the initial pivot point is known to be reasonable, then it may be 
possible to skip it in the grid
  search for the rotor frame order model.  This can lead to a speed up of the 
analysis and can help
  with stability.  The pivot_search argument has been added to the 
auto-analysis
  Optimisation.add_grid() method to enable this.  The get_grid_pivot_search() 
method has also been
  added to allow the auto-analysis to query this and turn it off if desired.
........
  r26393 | bugman | 2014-10-28 11:24:45 +0100 (Tue, 28 Oct 2014) | 5 lines
  
  Updated the description of the frame_order.permute_axes user function.
  
  This now includes the isotopic cone.
........
  r26394 | bugman | 2014-10-28 14:23:43 +0100 (Tue, 28 Oct 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Replaced the table in the frame_order.permute_axes user function.
  
  The original table was an old and incorrect version.  This has been 
replaced by the correct
  permutation table.
........
  r26396 | bugman | 2014-11-01 12:36:07 +0100 (Sat, 01 Nov 2014) | 7 lines
  
  Added some old relax scripts for both simulating and predicting the frame 
order matrix elements.
  
  These were used for the initial implementation of the pseudo-ellipse frame 
order model back in July
  2010.  The scripts will be extended for all frame order models.  The 
simulated values could then be
  used in unit tests of the frame order matrix code in lib.frame_order.
........
  r26397 | bugman | 2014-11-01 14:09:17 +0100 (Sat, 01 Nov 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Updated the frame_order_simulate.py script for simulating frame order 
matrix elements.
  
  The MODEL variable has been added in preparation for supporting all model 
types, and this is now
  added to the file name.  The Grace header is now also being automatically 
generated.

  Updated the frame_order_solution.py script for directly calculating the 
frame order matrix elements.
  
  The MODEL variable has been added in preparation for supporting all model 
types, and this is now
  added to the file name.  The Grace header is now also being automatically 
generated and this matches
  that for the frame_order_simulation.py script.

  r26400 | bugman | 2014-11-01 17:00:00 +0100 (Sat, 01 Nov 2014) | 5 lines
  
  Zero values can now be handled in the pseudo-ellipse 1st degree frame order 
matrix function.
  
  This is in 
lib.frame_order.pseudo_ellipse.compile_1st_matrix_pseudo_ellipse().
........
  r26401 | bugman | 2014-11-01 17:01:58 +0100 (Sat, 01 Nov 2014) | 7 lines
  
  Removed some unused code in the pseudo-ellipse 2nd degree frame order 
matrix function.
  
  This is the compile_2nd_matrix_pseudo_ellipse() function in the 
lib.frame_order.pseudo_ellipse
  module.  The change should make the RDC part of the frame order analysis 
for the pseudo-ellipse
  model slightly faster.
........
  r26402 | bugman | 2014-11-01 17:57:15 +0100 (Sat, 01 Nov 2014) | 5 lines
  
  Modified the rotate_daeg() function as this is independent of the degree of 
the frame order matrix.
  
  This is the lib.frame_order.matrix_ops.rotate_daeg() function.
........
  r26403 | bugman | 2014-11-01 18:00:21 +0100 (Sat, 01 Nov 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Fix for the compile_1st_matrix_pseudo_ellipse() function.
  
  This function of the lib.frame_order.pseudo_ellipse module now can rotate 
the 1st degree frame order
  matrix out of its eigenframe and into the PDB frame.

  Created an executable Python script for mass converting the frame order 
matrix Grace graphs.
  
  The script converts the *.agr files to EPS and PNG files.

  r26405 | bugman | 2014-11-01 18:04:10 +0100 (Sat, 01 Nov 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Modified the frame order matrix Grace graph to EPS/PNG format conversion 
script.
  
  The binary being called is now 'grace' rather than 'xmgrace'.  This allows 
different Grace versions
  to be used.
........
  r26406 | bugman | 2014-11-01 20:13:38 +0100 (Sat, 01 Nov 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Modified the frame order matrix Grace graph to EPS/PNG format conversion 
script.
  
  Grace is now used to create a PostScript file and then the ps2eps program 
is called to convert to
  EPS.  This produces much better EPS files for inclusion into LaTeX 
documents.
........
  r26407 | bugman | 2014-11-01 20:22:26 +0100 (Sat, 01 Nov 2014) | 8 lines
  
  Redesign of the frame_order_solution.py script for calculating the frame 
order matrix elements.
  
  This script now loops over all models, all motional frame orientations, and 
all order parameters to
  generate the Grace graphs of all 1st and 2nd degree frame order matrix 
elements.  Therefore the
  script only needs to be executed once.  The script also now calculates a 
point at zero (slightly
  shifted to 0.01 to avoid artifacts).
........
  r26408 | bugman | 2014-11-01 20:24:24 +0100 (Sat, 01 Nov 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Added all of the Grace graphs produced by the frame_order_solution.py 
script.
  
  These are the graphs of the 1st and 2nd degree frame order matrix elements, 
calculated using the
  functions in lib.frame_order.
........
  r26409 | bugman | 2014-11-02 15:39:25 +0100 (Sun, 02 Nov 2014) | 8 lines
  
  Updated frame_order_simulate.py to be much faster in simulating the frame 
order matrix elements.
  
  The script also matches the Grace file output of the 
frame_order_solution.py script.  The inside()
  method has been renamed for the pseudo-ellipse and the infrastructure for 
adding support for the
  other frame order models has been added.  By shifting calculations outside 
of the loops, the script
  is now many orders of magnitude faster.

  simulation values have been added to the repository.  The 
inside_free_rotor() method has been added
  to always return True for the rotation generated by rotation_z_axis().

  Simplifications and fixes for the 1st degree frame order matrix calculation 
for the pseudo-ellipse.
  
  The compile_1st_matrix_pseudo_ellipse() function of the 
lib.frame_order.pseudo_ellipse module has
  been significantly simplified by shifting a lot of maths outside of the 
quadratic integration.

  Updated all the calculated 1st degree frame order matrix graphs for the 
pseudo-ellipse.
  
  The changes are due to the fixes in the lib.frame_order.pseudo_ellipse 
module.

  Implemented the compile_1st_matrix_pseudo_ellipse_torsionless() function.
  
  This is for the lib.frame_order.pseudo_ellipse_torsionless module.  The 
function will calculate the
  1st degree in-frame frame order matrix for the torsionless pseudo-ellipse 
model.

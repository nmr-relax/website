    <h1>relax</h1>

    <p>The program relax is a software package designed for the study of molecular dynamics through the analysis of experimental NMR data.  Organic molecules, proteins, RNA, DNA, sugars, and other biomolecules are all supported.  It was originally written for the model-free analysis of protein dynamics, though its scope has been significantly expanded.</p>

    <p>relax is a community driven project created by NMR spectroscopists for NMR spectroscopists.  It supports a diverse range of analyses:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Model-free analysis - the Lipari and Szabo model-free analysis of NMR relaxation data.</li>
        <li>R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> - the exponential curve fitting for the calculation of the R<sub>x</sub> relaxation rates.</li>
        <li>NOE - the calculation of the steady-state NOE.</li>
        <li>Consistency testing of multiple field relaxation data.</li>
        <li>RSDM - Reduced Spectral Density Mapping.</li>
        <li>Frame order and N-state model - study of domain motions via the N-state model and frame order dynamics theories using anisotropic NMR parameters such as RDCs and PCSs.</li>
        <li>Stereochemistry investigations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The full list of features is described <a href="features.html">here</a>.</p>

    <div class="main_h2">
       <h2>Flexibility</h2>

          <p>The aim of relax is to provide a seamless and extremely flexible environment able to accept input in any format produced by other NMR software, able to faultlessly create input files, control, and read output from various model-free programs including <a href="http://cpmcnet.columbia.edu/dept/gsas/biochem/labs/palmer">Modelfree</a> and <a href="http://www.nmr.ru/dasha.html">Dasha</a>, output results in many formats, and visualise the data by controlling programs such as <a href="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace">Grace</a>, <a href="http://www.opendx.org">OpenDX</a>, and <a href="http://hugin.ethz.ch/wuthrich/software/molmol/">MOLMOL</a>.</p>

          <p>All data analysis tools from optimisation to model selection to Monte Carlo simulations are inbuilt into relax.  Therefore the use of additional programs is optional.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="main_h2">
      <h2>The power of Python</h2>

        <p>The flexibility of relax arises from the choice of either relax's scripting capabilities or its Python prompt interface.  Extremely complex scripts can be created from simple building blocks to fully automate data analysis.  A number of sample scripts have been provided to help understand script construction.  In addition, any of Python's powerful features or functions can be incorporated as the script is executed as an arbitrary Python source file within relax's environment.</p>

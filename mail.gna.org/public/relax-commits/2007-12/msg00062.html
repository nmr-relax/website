  Application of Seb's patch

  This patch 'patch__specific_fns__jw_mapping__trailing_spaces__l1.2_r3342' 
fixes
  a formating issue (trailing whitespaces) in the 1.2 line (revision 3342) for
  the file 'specific_fns/jw_mapping.py'.

    The file 'dx/isosurface_3D.py' was excluded from the patch set just to be 
on the safe side - the
    changes to this file could cause the OpenDX programs to fail.  See the

    This patch fixes the indentation issues - violations of the 4 spaces for 
a tab - within the 1.3
    line.

    Application of Sebastien Morin's 'patch__function_spacing__1.3_r3341' 
patch.
    
    See the post at 
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://mail.gna.org/public/relax-devel/2007-07/msg00037.html">https://mail.gna.org/public/relax-devel/2007-07/msg00037.html</a> for the patch.
    
    This patch (patch__function_spacing__1.3_r3341) fixes function spacing 
formating
    issues in the 1.3 line (r3341). The convention is to leave two empty lines
    before a function definition. The issues were found with the 
code_validator
    script and filtered so that when a function definition followed a class
    docstring or class variable, only one empty line is left instead of two.

    Fix for bug #9562 (<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://gna.org/bugs/?9562">http://gna.org/bugs/?9562</a>).
    
    This bug was reported and fixed by Sebastien Morin (sebastien dot morin 
dot 1 at ulaval dot ca) by
    the patch 'patch__specific_fns__jw_mapping__l1.3_r3342' attached to the 
bug report.
    
    In the 1.3 line, revision 3342, there is a typo in the 'set()' function 
of the file
    'specific_fns/jw_mapping.py'.  The string 'csa' is used twice on line 
398.  The string 'csa' should
    be used first and, then, the string 'r'.

    Application of Seb's patch 'patch__empty_line_after_docstring__1.3_r3342'.
    
    The patch is located at 
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://mail.gna.org/public/relax-devel/2007-07/msg00047.html">https://mail.gna.org/public/relax-devel/2007-07/msg00047.html</a>.
    
    This patch (patch__empty_line_after_docstring__1.3_r3342) fixes formating 
issues concerning missing
    empty lines after docstrings as found using the code_validator script.  
Two other small changes are
    also made in the 'float.py' file where a docstring was introduced with 4 
' symbols ('''') instead of
    3 (''') and where there was no space between a # symbol and the following 
text (a comment).

    Application of Sebastien Morin's patch creating the N15_CSA and 
NH_BOND_LENGTH constants.
    
    For the patch, see the post at

    The patch 'patch__default_csa_r__l1.3_r3351' makes uniform the use of the 
CSA value (now -172 ppm
    everywhere) and fixes the test-suite (in jw_mapping) to account for this 
change. It also adds two
    constants for the CSA and NH bond length default values.

    The fix was to simply test for the presence of the data structures.  If 
these spin system specific

  has the model None associated with it.  These situations are now caught and 
skipped.

    This bug was caused by the move away from using the __builtin__ 
namespace.  As the file is now
    treated as a module from which errors must be imported, the 
AllRelaxErrors object was not being
    created.  The solution was to add the function 'all_errors()' which 
returns a list of all the
    RelaxError objects.

    More unit tests for the generic_fns.residue.copy() function.
    
    The current test was renamed.  Two new tests were added for copying 
between molecules and copying
    between data pipes.

    A large number of changes to make the residue.copy() user function fully 
functional.
    
    Now residue data can be copied within a single molecule, between 
molecules, and between data pipes.

    Added a test for the failure of the 
generic_fns.selection.return_residue() function.
    
    This tests the failure of asking for a non-existent data pipe and the 
function has been fixed to
    fail appropriately.

    Added the 'return_single_molecule_info()' function and fixed the 
'return_molecule()' function.
    
    The 'return_molecule()' function was returning a molecule container when 
no molecule selection was
    given.  Now None is returned.

    Modified the 'generic_fns.residue.copy()' function to work with the 
modified 'return_molecule()' fn.
    
    Five unit test were failing due to the previous commit.  This was because 
of a problem in
    'generic_fns.residue.copy()' that wasn't previously detected.

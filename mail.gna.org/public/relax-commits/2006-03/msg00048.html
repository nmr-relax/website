 One of the philosophies in the construction of relax is that if there is 
something which is not immediately obvious, then that is considered a design 
bug.  If any flaws in relax are uncovered, including general design flaws, 
bugs in the code, or documentation issues, these can be reported within 
relax's bug tracker system.  The link to submit a bug is

Please do not report bugs to personal email addresses or to the mailing lists.
 
-When reporting a bug, please include as much information as posible so that 
it can be reproduced.  Include information such as the release version or the 
revision number if the repository sources are being used.  Also include all 
the steps performed in order to trigger the bug.  Attachment of files is 
allowed, so scripts and subsets of the input data can be included.  Make sure 
that you are confident that the problem is trully a bug prior to reporting 
it, if you have any doubts please feel free to ask on the relax-users mailing

\href{<a  href="http://download.gna.org/relax/}{http://download.gna.org/relax/}">http://download.gna.org/relax/}{http://download.gna.org/relax/}</a>.  If a 
compiled binary distribution for your architecture does not exist, you are 
welcome to create this distribution yourself.  To do this, a number of steps 
are required.  Firstly, the code to each relax release or version resides in 
the `tags' directory of the relax repository.  To check out version 1.2.3, 
for example, type
+
+\example{\$ svn co svn://svn.gna.org/svn/relax/tags/1.2.3 relax}
+
+Again, the sources are availible through HTTP by typing
+
+\example{\$ svn co <a  href="http://svn.gna.org/svn/relax/tags/1.2.3">http://svn.gna.org/svn/relax/tags/1.2.3</a> relax}
+
+The binary distribution can then be created for your architecture by 
shifting to the main directory of the checked out sources and typing
+
+\begin{exampleenv}
+\$ cd relax \\
+\$ scons binary\_dist
+\end{exampleenv}
+
+At the end, Sconstruct will attempt to make a GPG signature for the newly 
created archive, however, this will fail as the current relax private GPG key 
is not availible for security reasons.  If the Sconstruct command fails, 
excluding the GPG signing, please submit a bug report with as much 
information possible including the details described next to 
\href{<a  href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/bugs/?group=relax\&amp;func=additem}{https://gna.org/bugs/?group=relax\&amp;func=additem}">https://gna.org/bugs/?group=relax\&amp;func=additem}{https://gna.org/bugs/?group=relax\&amp;func=additem}</a>
 (the python and Sconstruct version numbers may also be useful).  Once the 
file has been created, post a message to the relax development mailing list 
describing the compilation and the creation of the archive, the relax version 
number, the machine architecture, operating system, and the name of the new 
file.  Do not attach the file though.  You will then receive a response 
explaining where to send the file to.  For security, the archive will be 
throughly checked and if the source code is identical to that in the 
repository and the C modules are okay, the file will be GPG signed and 
uploaded to

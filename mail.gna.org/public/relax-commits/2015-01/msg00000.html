  Added the norm_type argument to the grace.write user function.
  
  This is in response to 
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.devel/7392/focus=7438">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.devel/7392/focus=7438</a>.
  
  This norm_type argument can either be 'first' or 'last' to allow different 
points of the plot to be
  the normalisation factor.  The default of 'first' preserves the old 
behaviour of first point
  normalisation.
........
  r27036 | bugman | 2014-12-09 08:36:47 +0100 (Tue, 09 Dec 2014) | 5 lines
  
  The relax_fit_saturation_recovery.py system test script now sets the 
norm_type argument.
  
  This is for testing out this new option for the grace.write user function.
........
  r27037 | bugman | 2014-12-09 08:41:45 +0100 (Tue, 09 Dec 2014) | 6 lines
  
  The new grace.write user function norm_type argument has been activated.
  
  The argument is now passed from pipe_control.grace.write into the 
write_xy_data() function of the
  lib.software.grace module, and is used to select which point to use for the 
normalisation.
........
  r27038 | bugman | 2014-12-09 08:47:10 +0100 (Tue, 09 Dec 2014) | 7 lines
  
  The relaxation exponential curve-fitting auto-analysis now sets the 
normalisation type.
  
  This is for the new grace.write user function.  If the model for all spins 
is set to 'sat', then the
  norm_type will be set to 'last'.  This allows for reasonable normalised 
curves for the saturation
  recovery R1 experiment types.
........
  r27039 | bugman | 2014-12-09 08:54:53 +0100 (Tue, 09 Dec 2014) | 7 lines
  
  Change for norm_type variable in the relaxation exponential curve-fitting 
auto-analysis.
  
  This is now set to 'last', not only for the saturation recovery, but now 
also for the inversion
  recovery experiment types.  This ensures that the normalisation point is 
the steady state
  magnetisation peak intensity.
........
  r27040 | bugman | 2014-12-09 09:04:20 +0100 (Tue, 09 Dec 2014) | 8 lines
  
  Cleared the list of blacklisted objects for the cdp.exp_info data structure.
  
  The data_store.exp_info.ExpInfo class blacklist variable had previously not 
been used.  But after
  recent changes, the list was now active.  As all the contents of the 
container were blacklisted, the
  container was being initialised as being empty when reading the XML 
formatted state or results
  files.  Therefore the blacklist is now set to an empty list.

  Improvements for all of the tables of the relaxation dispersion chapter of 
the manual.
  
  The captions are now the full width (or height for rotated tables) of the 
page in the PDF version of
  the manual.  The \latex{} command from the latex2html package has been used 
to improve the HTML
  versions of the tables by deactivating the landscape environment, the 
cmidrule command, and the
  caption width commands.  This results in properly HTML formatted tables, 
rather than creating a PNG
  image for the whole table.  These should significantly improve the tables 
in the webpages

  Created the Structure.test_align_molecules system test.
  
  This will be used to extend the functionality of the structure.align user 
function to be able to
  align different molecules in the same data pipe, rather than requiring 
either models or identically
  named structures in different data pipes.
........
  r27053 | bugman | 2014-12-10 14:05:33 +0100 (Wed, 10 Dec 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Modified the Structure.test_align_molecules system test.
  
  This now simultaneously checks both the pipes and molecules arguments to 
the structure.align user
  function.
........
  r27054 | bugman | 2014-12-10 14:11:11 +0100 (Wed, 10 Dec 2014) | 3 lines
  
  More changes for the new Structure.test_align_molecules system test.
........
  r27055 | bugman | 2014-12-10 14:12:18 +0100 (Wed, 10 Dec 2014) | 3 lines
  
  Some more fixes for the Structure.test_align_molecules system test.
........
  r27056 | bugman | 2014-12-10 15:53:34 +0100 (Wed, 10 Dec 2014) | 7 lines
  
  Change to the Structure.test_align system test.
  
  The molecules argument for the structure.align user function has been 
changed to match the models
  argument, in that it now needs to be a list of lists with the first 
dimension matching the pipes
  argument.  This change is to help with the implementation of the new 
structure.align functionality.
........
  r27057 | bugman | 2014-12-10 15:56:46 +0100 (Wed, 10 Dec 2014) | 9 lines
  
  Implemented the new molecules argument for the structure.align user 
function.
  
  In addition to accepting the new argument, the user function backend has 
been redesigned for
  flexibility.  The assembly of coordinates and final rotations and 
translations now consist of three
  loops over desired data pipes, all models, and all molecules.  If the 
models or molecules arguments
  are supplied, then the models or molecules in the loop which do not match 
are skipped.  This logic
  simplifies and cleans up the backend.
........
  r27058 | bugman | 2014-12-10 16:37:18 +0100 (Wed, 10 Dec 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Created the Structure.test_rmsd_molecules system test.
  
  This will be used to implement a new molecules argument for the 
structure.rmsd user function so that
  the RMSD between different molecules rather than different models can be 
calculated.
........
  r27059 | bugman | 2014-12-10 17:03:24 +0100 (Wed, 10 Dec 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Implemented the new molecules argument for the structure.rmsd user function.
  
  This allows the RMSD between different molecules rather than different 
models to be calculated,
  extending the functionality of this user function.
........
  r27060 | bugman | 2014-12-10 17:07:08 +0100 (Wed, 10 Dec 2014) | 3 lines
  
  Removed some temporary printouts from the structure.align user function.
........
  r27061 | bugman | 2014-12-10 17:20:19 +0100 (Wed, 10 Dec 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Created the Structure.test_displacement_molecules system test.
  
  This will be used to implement the new molecules argument for the 
structure.displacement user
  function.
........
  r27062 | bugman | 2014-12-10 17:34:55 +0100 (Wed, 10 Dec 2014) | 7 lines
  
  Implemented the molecules argument for the structure.displacement user 
function.
  
  This allows the displacements (translations and rotations) to be calculated 
between different
  molecules rather than different models.  This information is stored in the 
dictionaries of the
  cdp.structure.displacement object with the keys set to the molecule list 
indices.
........
  r27063 | bugman | 2014-12-10 18:53:48 +0100 (Wed, 10 Dec 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Created the Structure.test_find_pivot system test.
  
  This is to check the structure.find_pivot user function as this algorithm 
is currently not being
  checked in the test suite.
........
  r27064 | bugman | 2014-12-10 18:57:14 +0100 (Wed, 10 Dec 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Created the Structure.test_find_pivot_molecules system test.
  
  This will be used to implement support for a molecules argument in the 
structure.find_pivot user
  function so that different molecules rather than different models can be 
used in the analysis.
........
  r27065 | bugman | 2014-12-11 08:37:45 +0100 (Thu, 11 Dec 2014) | 3 lines
  
  Increased the precision of pivot optimisation in the 
Structure.test_find_pivot_molecules system test.
........
  r27066 | bugman | 2014-12-11 08:41:07 +0100 (Thu, 11 Dec 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Implemented the molecules argument for the structure.find_pivot user 
function.
  
  This allows the motional pivot optimisation between different molecules 
rather than different
  models.
........
  r27067 | bugman | 2014-12-11 08:58:36 +0100 (Thu, 11 Dec 2014) | 8 lines
  
  Shifted the atomic assembly code from the structure.align user function 
into its own function.
  
  The new function assemble_coordinates() of the pipe_control.structure.main 
module will be used to
  standardise the process of assembling atomic coordinates for all of the 
structure user functions.
  This will improve the support for comparing different molecules rather than 
different models as
  missing atoms or divergent primary sequence are properly handled, and it 
has multi-pipe support.
........
  r27068 | bugman | 2014-12-11 09:04:35 +0100 (Thu, 11 Dec 2014) | 5 lines
  
  Changed the argument order for the structure.align user function.
  
  The standardised order will now be pipes, models, molecules, atom_id, etc.
........
  r27069 | bugman | 2014-12-11 09:25:06 +0100 (Thu, 11 Dec 2014) | 12 lines
  
  Converted the structure.find_pivot user function to the new 
pipes/models/molecules/atom_id design.
  
  This allows the motional pivot algorithm to work on atomic coordinates from 
different data pipes,
  different structural models, and different molecules.  The change allows the
  Structure.test_find_pivot_molecules system test to now pass, as missing 
atomic data is now correctly
  handled.  The user function backend uses the new 
pipe_control.structure.main.assemble_coordinates()
  function.
  
  The Structure.test_find_pivot and Structure.test_find_pivot_molecules 
system tests have been updated
  for the user function argument changes.
........
  r27070 | bugman | 2014-12-11 09:44:53 +0100 (Thu, 11 Dec 2014) | 12 lines
  
  Shift of the atomic coordinate assembly code into the relax library.
  
  Most of the pipe_control.structure.main.assemble_coordinates() function has 
been shifted into the
  assemble_coord_array() function of the new 
lib.structure.internal.coordinates module.  The
  pipe_control function now only checks the arguments and assembles the 
structural objects from the
  relax data store, and then calls assemble_coord_array() to do all of the 
work.
  
  This code abstraction increases the usefulness of the atomic coordinate 
assembly and allows it to be
  significantly expanded in the future, for example by being able to take 
sequence alignments into
  consideration.

  Tooltip standardisation for the structure.align and structure.find_pivot 
user functions.

  The coordinate assembly function now returns list of unique IDs.
  
  This is for each structural object, model and molecule.
........
  r27074 | bugman | 2014-12-11 10:33:05 +0100 (Thu, 11 Dec 2014) | 6 lines
  
  Changed the structure ID strings returned by the assemble_coord_array() 
function.
  
  This is from the lib.structure.internal.coordinates module.  The structural 
object name is only
  included if more than one structural object has been supplied.
........
  r27075 | bugman | 2014-12-11 10:38:43 +0100 (Thu, 11 Dec 2014) | 3 lines
  
  More improvements for the structure ID strings returned by the 
assemble_coord_array() function.

  Converted the internal structural displacement object to use unique IDs 
rather than model numbers.
  
  This allows the object to be much more flexible in what types of structures 
it can handle.  This is
  in preparation for a change in the structure.displacement user function.
........
  r27078 | bugman | 2014-12-11 10:50:16 +0100 (Thu, 11 Dec 2014) | 9 lines
  
  Converted the structure.displacement user function to the new 
pipes/models/molecules/atom_id design.
  
  This allows the displacements to be calculated between atomic coordinates 
from different data pipes,
  different structural models, and different molecules.  The user function 
backend has been hugely
  simplified as it now uses the new 
pipe_control.structure.main.assemble_coordinates() function.
  
  The Structure.test_displacement system test has been updated for the user 
function argument changes.
........
  r27079 | bugman | 2014-12-11 10:55:24 +0100 (Thu, 11 Dec 2014) | 3 lines
  
  Another refinement for the structure ID strings returned by the

  Converted the structure.rmsd user function to the new 
pipes/models/molecules/atom_id design.
  
  This allows the RMSD calculation to work on atomic coordinates from 
different data pipes, different
  structural models, and different molecules.  The user function backend uses 
the new
  pipe_control.structure.main.assemble_coordinates() function.
  
  The Structure.test_rmsd_molecules system test has been updated for the user 
function argument
  changes.

  Created the internal structural object model_list() method.
  
  This is to simplify the assembly of a list of all current models in the 
structural object.
........
  r27084 | bugman | 2014-12-11 11:37:33 +0100 (Thu, 11 Dec 2014) | 8 lines
  
  Converted the structure.superimpose user function to the new 
pipes/models/molecules/atom_id design.
  
  The user function arguments have not changed, however the backend now uses 
the new
  pipe_control.structure.main.assemble_coordinates() function.  This is to 
simply decrease the number
  of failure points possible in the structure user functions.  The change has 
no effect on the user
  function use or results.

  Documentation fix for the assemble_coord_array() function.
  
  The return values for

  Modified the Structure.test_bug_22070_structure_superimpose_after_deletion

  Fixes for the structure.superimpose and structure.align user functions.
  
  The fit_to_mean() and fit_to_first() functions of lib.structure.superimpose 
where being incorrectly
  called, in that they expect a list of elements and not lists of lists.

  Code refactorisation for the structure.align user function backend.
  
  The looping over data pipes, model numbers, and molecule names, skipping 
those that don't match the
  function arguments, has been shifted into the new structure_loop() 
generator function of the
  pipe_control.structure.main module.  This function assembles the data from 
the data store and then
  calls the new loop_coord_structures() generator function of the 
lib.structure.internal.coordinates
  module which does all of the work.

  r27090 | bugman | 2014-12-11 13:40:41 +0100 (Thu, 11 Dec 2014) | 9 lines
  
  Refactored the descriptions of a number of structure user functions.
  
  This includes the structure.align, structure.displacement, 
structure.find_pivot, structure.rmsd and
  structure.superimpose user functions.  The paragraph_multi_struct and 
paragraph_atom_id module
  strings have been created and are shared as two paragraphs for each of 
these user function
  descriptions.  This standardises the pipe/model/molecule/atom_id 
descriptions.  The user function
  wizard page sizes have been updated for these changes.
........
  r27091 | bugman | 2014-12-11 16:00:21 +0100 (Thu, 11 Dec 2014) | 10 lines
  
  Changed the design of the 
lib.structure.internal.coordinates.assemble_coord_array() function.
  
  The elements_flag argument has been renamed to seq_info_flag.  If this is 
set, then in addition to
  the atomic elements, the molecule name, residue name, residue number, and 
atom name is now assembled
  and returned.  This information is now the common information between the 
structures, hence the
  return values for the elements are a list of str rather than list of lists.
  
  All of the code in pipe_control.structure.main has been updated for the 
change.

  Fix for the structure.align user function if no data pipes are supplied.
  
  The pipes list was no longer being created as it was shifted to the

  Bug fix for the lib.arg_check.is_int_list() function for checking a list of 
lists.
  
  This is used to check user function arguments, but was causing a RelaxError 
to be raised for all
  integer list of lists user function arguments when a valid value is 
supplied.  The function has been
  updated to match the is_str_list() function which does not suffer from this 
bug.

  Converted the structure.web_of_motion user function to the new 
pipe/model/molecule/atom_id design.
  
  This allows the web of motion representation to work on atomic coordinates 
from different data
  pipes, different structural models, and different molecules.  The user 
function backend uses the new
  pipe_control.structure.main.assemble_coordinates() function to assemble the 
common atom coordinates,
  molecule names, residue names, residue numbers, atom names and elements.  
All this information is
  then used to construct the new web of motion PDB file.  Therefore the 
entire backend has been
  rewritten.
  
  The Structure.test_web_of_motion_12, Structure.test_web_of_motion_13, and
  Structure.test_web_of_motion_all system tests have all been updated for the 
changed
  structure.web_of_motion user function arguments.  In addition, the system 
tests
  Structure.test_web_of_motion_12_molecules, 
Structure.test_web_of_motion_13_molecules and
  Structure.test_web_of_motion_all_molecules have been created as a copy of 
the other tests but with
  the 3 structures loaded as different molecules.

  Fix for the IDs returned by 
lib.structure.internal.coordinates.assemble_coord_array().
  
  The list of unique structure IDs was being incorrectly constructed if 
multiple molecules are present
  but the molecules argument was not supplied.  It would be of a different 
size to the coordinate data
  structure.

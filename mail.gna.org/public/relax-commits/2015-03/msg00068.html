  r27707 | bugman | 2015-02-20 16:16:02 +0100 (Fri, 20 Feb 2015) | 6 lines
  
  Python 3 fix for the new internal structural object MolContainer._sort() 
method.
  
  The list() builtin function is required to convert the output of the 
range() function into a true
  list in Python 3, so that the list.sort() method can be accessed.
........
  r27708 | bugman | 2015-02-20 16:46:14 +0100 (Fri, 20 Feb 2015) | 7 lines
  
  Python 3 fix for the Test_msa.test_central_star unit test.
  
  This is from the _lib._sequence_alignment.test_msa unit test module.  The 
logic of range() + range()
  does not work in Python 3, so the range function calls are now wrapped in 
list() function calls to
  convert to the correct data structure type.
........
  r27709 | bugman | 2015-02-20 16:51:33 +0100 (Fri, 20 Feb 2015) | 6 lines
  
  Python 3 fix for the internal structural object MolContainer._sort_key() 
method.
  
  This method is used as the key for the sort() function.  However in Python 
3, the key cannot be
  None.  So now if the residue number is None, the value of 0 is returned 
instead.
........
  r27710 | bugman | 2015-02-20 16:54:24 +0100 (Fri, 20 Feb 2015) | 6 lines
  
  Python 3 fix for the 
pipe_control.structure.main.assemble_structural_coordinates() function.
  
  This affects most of the structure user functions.  This was another case 
of requiring the list()
  built in function to create a list object from an iterator.
........
  r27711 | bugman | 2015-02-20 16:56:44 +0100 (Fri, 20 Feb 2015) | 5 lines
  
  Another Python 3 list() fix for the structure user functions.
  
  This time the problem was in the 
pipe_control.structure.main.sequence_alignment() function.
........
  r27712 | bugman | 2015-02-23 10:06:59 +0100 (Mon, 23 Feb 2015) | 9 lines
  
  Large speed up of the structure.web_of_motion user function.
  
  With the introduction of the _sort() internal structural object method and 
it being called by the
  add_atom(), the structure.web_of_motion user function was now painfully 
slow.  As sorting the
  structural data is unnecessary for the backend of this user function, the 
add_atom() boolean
  argument 'sort' has been added to turn the sorting on and off, and the 
structure.web_of_motion
  backend now sets this to False.
........
  r27713 | bugman | 2015-02-23 11:49:05 +0100 (Mon, 23 Feb 2015) | 6 lines
  
  Fix for the internal structural object unit test 
Test_object.test_add_atom_sort.
  
  This test of the _lib._structure._internal.test_object unit test module now 
requires the sort
  argument set to True when calling the add_atom() method.
........
  r27714 | bugman | 2015-02-23 11:50:54 +0100 (Mon, 23 Feb 2015) | 3 lines
  
  Fix for a RelaxError message from the internal structural object when 
validating models.
........
  r27717 | bugman | 2015-02-24 12:08:43 +0100 (Tue, 24 Feb 2015) | 3 lines
  
  Improvement for a RelaxError message when assembling structural data but no 
coordinates can be found.
........
  r27718 | bugman | 2015-02-25 13:46:35 +0100 (Wed, 25 Feb 2015) | 6 lines
  
  Created a series of unit tests for implementing a new internal structural 
object feature.
  
  These tests check a new 'inv' argument for the selection() structural 
object method for allowing all
  atoms not matching the atom ID string to be selected.
........
  r27719 | bugman | 2015-02-25 13:58:45 +0100 (Wed, 25 Feb 2015) | 6 lines
  
  Implemented the new 'inv' argument for the selection() structural object 
method.
  
  This allows for all atoms not matching the atom ID string to be selected.  
The unit tests for this
  argument now all pass, validating the implementation.
........
  r27722 | bugman | 2015-03-02 11:58:42 +0100 (Mon, 02 Mar 2015) | 6 lines
  
  Improvement for the structure.mean user function.
  
  This can now be used to store an averaged structure in an empty data pipe.  
Previously structural
  data needed to be present in the current data pipe for the user function to 
work.
........
  r27723 | bugman | 2015-03-02 15:32:59 +0100 (Mon, 02 Mar 2015) | 9 lines
  
  Bug fix for the results.write user function when loading relax state files.
  
  The results.write user function can load not only the results file 
consisting of a single data pipe,
  but also relax state files if only a single pipe is present.  However this 
was causing the current
  data pipe and other pipe-independent data (sequence alignments and the GUI) 
to be overwritten, just
  as when loading a state file.  Now only the data from the data pipe will be 
loaded and the pipe
  independent data in the state file will be ignored.
........
  r27724 | bugman | 2015-03-02 15:34:59 +0100 (Mon, 02 Mar 2015) | 6 lines
  
  Fix for the rdc.write user function.
  
  The check for the missing rdc_data_types variable in the interatomic 
containers is now more
  comprehensive and checks for the presence of the alignment ID.
........
  r27725 | bugman | 2015-03-02 16:55:08 +0100 (Mon, 02 Mar 2015) | 6 lines
  
  Created a system test to show a limitation of the rdc.copy user function.
  
  Currently, it cannot work when spin systems in two data pipes are 
different.  The system test will
  be used to implement the support.
........
  r27726 | bugman | 2015-03-02 17:16:44 +0100 (Mon, 02 Mar 2015) | 6 lines
  
  Simplification of the new Rdc.test_rdc_copy_different_spins system test.
  
  This no longer tests the deletion of interatomic data containers by the 
spin.delete user function,
  something which is not implemented.
........
  r27727 | bugman | 2015-03-02 17:16:56 +0100 (Mon, 02 Mar 2015) | 3 lines
  
  Copyright update.
........
  r27728 | bugman | 2015-03-02 17:21:04 +0100 (Mon, 02 Mar 2015) | 3 lines
  
  Added a printout to the sequence.attach_protons user function listing all 
the newly created spins.
........

........
  r27730 | bugman | 2015-03-02 17:24:08 +0100 (Mon, 02 Mar 2015) | 5 lines
  
  Some more fixes for the Rdc.test_rdc_copy_different_spins system test.
  
  The residue.delete and not spin.delete user function is required to delete 
the sequence data.
........
  r27731 | bugman | 2015-03-02 17:27:21 +0100 (Mon, 02 Mar 2015) | 5 lines
  
  Another small fix for the new Rdc.test_rdc_copy_different_spins system test.
  
  The rdc.copy user function requires the pipe_to argument to be supplied in 
this case.
........
  r27732 | bugman | 2015-03-02 18:09:12 +0100 (Mon, 02 Mar 2015) | 8 lines
  
  Expansion of the Rdc.test_rdc_copy_different_spins system test.
  
  The interatomic data containers are now defined via the interatom.define 
user function, which
  requires the spin.element user function to set up the element information.  
A printout has also been
  added to demonstrate a failure in the 
pipe_control.interatomic.interatomic_loop() function in
  handling the correct data pipe.
........
  r27733 | bugman | 2015-03-02 18:13:09 +0100 (Mon, 02 Mar 2015) | 8 lines
  
  Big bug fix for the pipe_control.interatomic.interatomic_loop() function.
  
  This was identified in the Rdc.test_rdc_copy_different_spins system test.  
The problem was that the
  pipe argument was being ignored when looking up the spin containers.  Hence 
if the pipe being worked
  on was not the current data pipe, and the spin sequences were not 
identical, the function would
  fail.  This mainly affects the rdc.copy user function.
........
  r27734 | bugman | 2015-03-02 18:19:26 +0100 (Mon, 02 Mar 2015) | 6 lines
  
  Some more modifications for the Rdc.test_rdc_copy_different_spins system 
test.
  
  One of the interatomic data containers does not have RDC data, as it is not 
present in the original
  data pipe, hence this is checked for.  And the printouts have more 
formatting.
........
  r27735 | bugman | 2015-03-02 18:22:18 +0100 (Mon, 02 Mar 2015) | 7 lines
  
  Expanded the functionality of the rdc.copy user function.
  
  The user function will now operate on two data pipes with different spin 
sequences.  If the
  interatomic data container is missing from the target data pipe, a warning 
is given.  And if the
  interatomic data container is not present in the source data pipe, nothing 
will be copied.
........
  r27736 | bugman | 2015-03-03 13:43:44 +0100 (Tue, 03 Mar 2015) | 3 lines
  
  Modified the rdc.copy user function to printout all copied RDC values and 
errors.
........
  r27737 | bugman | 2015-03-03 13:51:18 +0100 (Tue, 03 Mar 2015) | 6 lines
  
  Created the Rdc.test_rdc_copy_back_calc system test.
  
  This will be used to implement the back_calc Boolean argument for the 
rdc.copy user function to
  allow not only measured, but also back-calculated RDC values to be copied.
........
  r27738 | bugman | 2015-03-03 13:53:48 +0100 (Tue, 03 Mar 2015) | 3 lines
  
  Modified the rdc.copy printout of RDCs to occur for each alignment ID.
........
  r27739 | bugman | 2015-03-03 14:01:13 +0100 (Tue, 03 Mar 2015) | 6 lines
  
  Implemented the back_calc argument for the rdc.copy user function.
  
  This allows the back-calculated RDCs to be additionally copied together 
with the real value and
  error.
........
  r27740 | bugman | 2015-03-03 14:06:31 +0100 (Tue, 03 Mar 2015) | 3 lines
  
  Small formatting change for the rdc.copy user function printouts.
........
  r27741 | bugman | 2015-03-03 14:17:41 +0100 (Tue, 03 Mar 2015) | 6 lines
  
  Created the Pcs.test_pcs_copy_different_spins system test.
  
  This will be used to show a limitation of the pcs.copy user function in 
that it cannot copy data
  between two data pipes with different molecule, residue, and spin sequences.
........
  r27742 | bugman | 2015-03-03 14:34:41 +0100 (Tue, 03 Mar 2015) | 7 lines
  
  Fix for the pcs.read user function.
  
  The problem was caught by the new Pcs.test_pcs_copy_different_spins system 
test.  If the spin system
  does not exist in the current data pipe, but data for it is present in the 
PCS file, the pcs.read
  user function would terminate in a TypeError.
........
  r27743 | bugman | 2015-03-03 14:38:33 +0100 (Tue, 03 Mar 2015) | 5 lines
  
  Added a printout of the alignment ID for the pcs.copy user function.
  
  This is to match the rdc.copy user function.
........
  r27744 | bugman | 2015-03-03 14:43:18 +0100 (Tue, 03 Mar 2015) | 7 lines
  
  Created the Pcs.test_pcs_copy_back_calc system test.
  
  This will be used to implement the back_calc Boolean argument for the 
pcs.copy user function to
  allow not only measured, but also back-calculated PCS values to be copied.  
It matches the
  equivalent Rdc.test_rdc_copy_back_calc system test.
........
  r27745 | bugman | 2015-03-03 14:46:20 +0100 (Tue, 03 Mar 2015) | 6 lines
  
  Implemented the back_calc argument for the pcs.copy user function.
  
  This allows the back-calculated PCSs to be additionally copied together 
with the real value and
  error.  The implementation simply copies that of the rdc.copy user function.
........
  r27746 | bugman | 2015-03-03 15:04:47 +0100 (Tue, 03 Mar 2015) | 5 lines
  
  Added full per-alignment data printouts to the pcs.copy user function to 
match rdc.copy.
  
  The feedback is important to know what was actually copied.

  Created the Rdc.test_calc_q_factors_no_tensor system test.
  
  This is to demonstrate a failure in the rdc.calc_q_factors user function 
when no alignment tensor is
  present.  In addition, the test is also triggering an earlier problem of 
spin isotope information
  being missing.  However the isotope is not required if the tensor is absent.

  Fixes for the rdc.calc_q_factors user function for when no alignment tensor

  This was caught by the Rdc.test_calc_q_factors_no_tensor system test.  Now 
if no tensor is present,
  a warning is given and the 2Da^2(4 + 3R)/5 normalised Q factor is skipped.  
Also, if present but no
  spin isotope information is present, then RelaxSpinTypeError errors are 
raised.

  Clarification of the RDC and PCS Q factors.
  
  This affects the rdc.calc_q_factors and pcs.calc_q_factors user functions, 
as well as all other
  operations involving the calculation of Q factors.  The printouts have been 
modified to clarify if
  the normalisation is via the tensor size (2Da^2(4 + 3R)/5) or via the sum 
of data squared, and the
  separation of the two is now clearer.  This allows for better RDC vs. PCS 
comparisons.
  
  In addition, the data pipe variable names have been updated to reflect the 
normalisation, so it is
  instantly known when looking at the XML contents of results or save files 
which was used.  The
  backwards compatibility hooks have been modified to support the data pipe 
variable name changes.

  The align_tensor.copy user function 'tensor_from' argument can now be None.
  
  This is to enable the copying of all alignment tensors from one data pipe 
to another.

  Modified the pipe_control.align_tensor.align_data_exists() function to 
handle no tensor IDs.
  
  If no tensor ID is supplied, this will then return True if any alignment 
data exists.

  Improvement for the align_tensor.copy user function.
  
  The user function has been modified to allow all alignment tensors to be 
copied between two data
  pipes.  This allows the Align_tensor.test_copy_pipes system test to pass.

  Fixes for the align_tensor.copy user function argument unit tests.
  
  The tensor_from and tensor_to arguments can now be None.

  Created the Align_tensor.test_copy_pipes_sims system test.
  
  This demonstrates a failure of the align_tensor.copy user function when 
Monte Carlo simulated
  tensors are present.

  Deleted the data_store.align_tensor.AlignTensorSimList.append() method.
  
  This replacement list method was proving fatal when copy.deepcopy() is 
called on the alignment
  tensor object.  The change allows the Align_tensor.test_copy_pipes_sims 
system test to pass.

  Huge speed up for loading results and state files with Monte Carlo 
simulation alignment tensors.
  
  The reading of the alignment tensor component of XML formatted results and 
state files has been
  modified.  Previously the 
data_store.align_tensor.AlignTensorData._update_object() method for
  updating the alignment tensor object (for values, errors, simulations) was 
being called once for
  each Monte Carlo simulation.  Now is it called only once for all 
simulations.  In one test, the
  reading of the save file with 500 simulations dropped from 253.7 to 10.0 
seconds.

  Added an extra check for the assembly of RDC data.
  
  This is in the pipe_control.rdc.return_rdc_data() function and the check is 
for any unit vectors set
  to None, which is a fatal condition.

  Improved the RelaxError message from the RDC assembly function when unit 
vectors are None.

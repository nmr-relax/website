  The unmodified Hessian and turning the line search off are no longer both

  Splitting of the 'pdb()' user function into 'pdb.read()' and 
'pdb.vectors()' (task #3838).
  
  These changes complete task #3838 (<a  href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/task/?3838">https://gna.org/task/?3838</a>).  The 
details of the changes were
  discussed at <a  href="http://www.nmr-relax.com/mail.gna.org/public/relax-users/2006-10/msg00002.html">https://mail.gna.org/public/relax-users/2006-10/msg00002.html</a> 
(Message-id:
  &lt;7f080ed10610032153o4571935bq138d2739f55ca3bd@xxxxxxxxxxxxxx&gt;).
  
  The only difference between the post proposing the changes and the actual 
changes is that the
  proposed user function 'pdb.set_vectors()' is actually now called 
'pdb.vectors()'.

  The command used was:
  $ svn merge -r2604:2605 svn+ssh://bugman@xxxxxxxxxxx/svn/relax/1.2

................
  r2607 | bugman | 2006-10-08 03:13:42 +1000 (Sun, 08 Oct 2006) | 7 lines
  
  Fix for bug #7333 (<a  href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?7333">https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?7333</a>).
  
  The three tests of the test-suite have been modified to use the correct PDB 
functions.  A few calls
  to the user function 'pdb.vectors()' needed to be added and the 'heteronuc' 
and 'proton' argments
  to the 'pdb.read()' funtion had to be removed.
................
  r2608 | bugman | 2006-10-08 03:24:08 +1000 (Sun, 08 Oct 2006) | 6 lines
  
  Fix for bug #7334 (<a  href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?7334">https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?7334</a>).
  
  The problem was that the relax base class in the PDB class of 
'prompt/pdb.py' was set to
  'self.__relax__'.  However two lines were attempting to use 'self.relax'.
................
  r2609 | bugman | 2006-10-08 03:37:56 +1000 (Sun, 08 Oct 2006) | 8 lines
  
  Fix for bug #7335 (<a  href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?7335">https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?7335</a>).
  
  The code which tests that the proton and heteronucleus have not been set to 
the same atom name has
  been moved from the 'self.read()' function to the 'self.vectors()' 
function.  Two more lines of
  code, which were placing the atom names into the 'self.relax.data.pdb' data 
structure were also
  identified to cause similar problems and were shifted from the read to the 
vectors function.
................
  r2610 | bugman | 2006-10-08 03:46:37 +1000 (Sun, 08 Oct 2006) | 7 lines
  
  Fix for bug #7336 (<a  href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?7336">https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?7336</a>).
  
  The user function 'pdb.vectors()' was not set up properly.  It was 
expecting the residue number to
  be an integer and the residue name to be a string.  However the default is 
that both are set to
  None.  This was causing a RelaxError.
................
  r2613 | bugman | 2006-10-12 13:20:26 +1000 (Thu, 12 Oct 2006) | 8 lines
  
  Ported r2611 from the 1.2 line.
  
  The command used was:
  $ svn merge -r2610:2611 svn+ssh://bugman@xxxxxxxxxxx/svn/relax/1.2
  
  This adds the directory for Scons Python modules for the Builder functions.
................
  r2614 | bugman | 2006-10-12 13:23:22 +1000 (Thu, 12 Oct 2006) | 8 lines
  
  Ported r2612 from the 1.2 line.
  
  The command used was:
  $ svn merge -r2611:2612 svn+ssh://bugman@xxxxxxxxxxx/svn/relax/1.2
  
  This completes the fixing of bug #7241 (<a  href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/bugs/?7241">https://gna.org/bugs/?7241</a>).
................
  r2615 | bugman | 2006-10-12 13:29:26 +1000 (Thu, 12 Oct 2006) | 5 lines
  
  The user function 'pdb.read()' still was accepting the arguements 
heteronuc='N' and proton='H'.
  
  The code of the user function was not using these or passing them on.  They 
have now been removed.
................
  r2617 | bugman | 2006-10-12 13:46:16 +1000 (Thu, 12 Oct 2006) | 8 lines
  
  Ported r2616 from the 1.2 line.
  
  The command used was:
  $ svn merge -r2615:2616 svn+ssh://bugman@xxxxxxxxxxx/svn/relax/1.2
  
  This removes the ancient unused file 'maths_fns/test.c_chi.py'.
................
  r2633 | bugman | 2006-10-12 17:43:25 +1000 (Thu, 12 Oct 2006) | 10 lines
  
  Ported r2618 to r2632 from the 1.2 line.
  
  The command used was:
  $ svn merge -r2617:2632 svn+ssh://bugman@xxxxxxxxxxx/svn/relax/1.2
  
  These changes all relate to the Scons system.  The Scons scripts have been 
completely overhauled.
  Bugs have been removed.  The help system has been redone.  A target for 
creating the API
  documentation using Epydoc has been added.

  Fixes for a number of bugs caused by the changes for task #3838.
  
  Task #3838 is located at <a  href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/task/?3838">https://gna.org/task/?3838</a> and more information is 
given at
  <a  href="http://www.nmr-relax.com/mail.gna.org/public/relax-users/2006-10/msg00002.html">https://mail.gna.org/public/relax-users/2006-10/msg00002.html</a> (Message-id:
  &lt;7f080ed10610032153o4571935bq138d2739f55ca3bd@xxxxxxxxxxxxxx&gt;).
  
  Part of the problem, the failure of two of the tests of the test suite was 
reported by Alex Hansen
  (viochemist _at_ gmail _dot_ com) in the post located at
  <a  href="http://www.nmr-relax.com/mail.gna.org/public/relax-devel/2006-10/msg00095.html">https://mail.gna.org/public/relax-devel/2006-10/msg00095.html</a> (Message-id:
  &lt;481156b20610130720u39a93e30k6d4603efd8730c96@xxxxxxxxxxxxxx&gt;).  Another 
failure was reported by
  Alex at <a  href="http://www.nmr-relax.com/mail.gna.org/public/relax-devel/2006-10/msg00096.html">https://mail.gna.org/public/relax-devel/2006-10/msg00096.html</a> 
(Message-id:
  &lt;481156b20610130728jb6aa76ag3d9487a20397391b@xxxxxxxxxxxxxx).
  
  The first fix, which was a missing run argument, is described at
  <a  href="http://www.nmr-relax.com/mail.gna.org/public/relax-devel/2006-10/msg00099.html">https://mail.gna.org/public/relax-devel/2006-10/msg00099.html</a> (Message-id:
  &lt;7f080ed10610130741j146721c8w512ba61bac3644c7@xxxxxxxxxxxxxx&gt;).
  
  The second problem was that the residue number and residue name was being 
referred to as 'num' and
  'name' when they should have been 'res_num' and 'res_name'.
  
  The third problem was an index for selecting the residue.  Rather than 
using the real index 'i', the
  index 'j' was being used.

  r2649 | bugman | 2006-10-17 15:09:57 +1000 (Tue, 17 Oct 2006) | 8 lines
  
  Ported r2635 from the 1.2 line.
  
  The command used was:
  $ svn merge -r2634:2635 svn+ssh://bugman@xxxxxxxxxxx/svn/relax/1.2
  
  This involves a few functions moving to the new Scons module file 
'scons/distrib.py'.

the distribution target
  functions, the creation of the new module 'scons.install', and a 
restructure of the base
  'sconstruct' file.

  The command used was:
  $ svn merge -r2659:2660 svn+ssh://bugman@xxxxxxxxxxx/svn/relax/1.2
  
  This fixes an error when trying to plot the MC simulation data in reduced 
spectral density mapping
  using the 'grace.write()' user function.

  Fixed the nucleic acid residue names.
  
  These names were being prefixed by 'R' by Scientific python, so residue 'G' 
would be labelled as
  residue 'RG'!  This was causing the user function 'pdb.vectors()' to fail 
as the residue was
  expected to be called 'G'.  The prefix 'R' is now stripped from the residue 
name.

  Fixed the overwriting of the residue specific xh_vect data structure.
  
  If the user function 'pdb.vectors()' was called twice, the vectors 
calculated from the first
  function call were being overwriten by the empty structure '[]'.  This is 
now fixed.

  The command used was:

  This improves the optimisation tests and makes them a little more lenient 
to allow for machine
  precision and round-off error artifacts on different architectures, 
operating systems, etc.

  Fix for bug #7540 (<a  href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?7540">https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?7540</a>).
  
  This bug was reported by Alex Hansen (viochemist at gmail dot com).  The 
problem was that the
  function 'self.relax.generic.pdb.load()' had been renamed to 
'self.relax.generic.pdb.read()'.  The
  correct function is now being called and the heteronucleus and proton name 
arguments, as well as the
  'calc_vectors' argument have been removed.

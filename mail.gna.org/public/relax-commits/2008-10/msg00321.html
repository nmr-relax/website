streams, as they are fused

  Converted the rest of the model selection to the model_loop() design.

  Fixes for the relax data store singleton 'add()', 'to_xml()', and 
'from_xml()' methods.
  
  These were referring to the contents of the singleton as self, whereas in 
reality with the current
  temporary implementation it is stored in self.instance.  Hence the 
singleton wasn't operating on

chi2 value are in the mfout
  file but are fixed or the sum of individual chi2 vals.
........

into the relax data store.
........
  r7677 | bugman | 2008-10-12 19:59:03 +0200 (Sun, 12 Oct 2008) | 8 lines
  
  Important bug fix!!
  
  The theta angle of the spheroidal diffusion tensor was being improperly 
wrapped between 0 and pi.
  This was causing the glide reflection symmetry to be broken, hence the 
tensor was incorrect.  The
  result would be longer optimisation times for the spheroid tensors and more 
iterations than
  necessary in the full_analysis.py script.

  Fix for bug #12437 (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/bugs/?12437">https://gna.org/bugs/?12437</a>).
  
  The problem was that the 'from_xml' and 'to_xml' methods needed to be 
blacklisted to prevent them
  from being restored from the pickled state.

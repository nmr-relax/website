 Hi,

 For the eta value calculated in the consistency_tests code, I don't know if
it is the eta_z or eta_xy value. In the original paper by Fushman &amp; Cowburn
(1998, JACS, 120: 7109-7110) as well as in the consistency tests paper
(Fushman et al., 1998, JACS, 120: 10947-10952), eta is only described as the
cross-correlation rate between 15N CSA and 15N-1H dipolar interaction.

 Hi Ed,

Here is the first part of the split patch as you asked for.

This one if for docstrings and comments in files :
/branches/consistency_tests_1.2/prompt/consistency_tests.py
/branches/consistency_tests_1.2/maths_fns/consistency_tests.py
/branches/consistency_tests_1.2/test_suite/consistency_tests.py
/branches/consistency_tests_1.2/sample_scripts/consistency_tests.py
/branches/consistency_tests_1.2/specific_fns/consistency_tests.py

Should the commit log be something like what follows ?

&quot;This patch
(patch_consistency_tests__l1.2_r3340__docstrings_and_comments)
corrects docstrings and comments errors which were remnants of the
jw_mapping
code from which the consistency_tests code was inspired. Also, this patch
adds
docstrings and comments to the code for making it easier for users to
understand what the code actually does.&quot;

Selon Edward d'Auvergne &lt;edward.dauvergne@xxxxxxxxx&gt;, 13.07.2007:



 Hi,

This patch will need a few small changes before being committed. The
first is the docstring of the set_frq function of
'prompt/consistency_tests.py'. In the user function docstrings, the
list of keyword arguments need to be separated by newlines. This is a
relax convention as can be seen in the equivalent function of
'prompt/jw_mapping.py'. One problem with this is that the docstring
parser used to generate the relax manual might fail in this keyword
argument section. An additional formatting convention is the use of
two blank lines in front of the section titles in the docstring. This
allows easier reading of the much longer docstrings.

This isn't important but for the eta value, do you know if this is
eta_z or eta_xy? A more important point is that the patch should be
split up so that there are different patches for different types of
fixes. For example there are docstring and comment changes which
could be grouped together into a single patch. Then there are
modifications to the test suite for the consistency tests which should
be separate. In 'specific_fns/consistency_tests.py' there
is a change
to the default value of the CSA and a number of other fundamental
changes. These should all be separate.

It would be a good exercise in preparation for having full commit
access to the relax repository to split this patch into a number of
small patches. No patch or commit to the relax repository should
contain two unrelated changes, even if these are tiny one line
changes. For each commit to the repository, a detailed description of
the changes should be placed into the commit log (which is
automatically emailed to the relax-commits mailing list but remains in
the repository and is important for repository maintenance). You can
see these messages by typing something like 'svn log -v --limit=100 |
less' within your checked out copy. So if you could prepare a similar
commit message for the patches, it would be much appreciated.

Cheers,

Edward


P.S. A small fix is needed in 'prompt/consistency_tests.py' at line
4. And as for the self.__relax_help_ string, this isn't actually a
docstring but is used by the relax prompt help system. These
__init__() functions don't have docstrings, and I don't remember if
this was deliberate because of the special help system or not.

 Hi,

Here is a patch for the consistency tests branch of the 1.2 line (r3340).

Some comments and docstrings were added as well as errors corrected from

 the


 adaptation of this code from the jw_mapping code...

The following file are modified :
 prompt/consistency_tests.py
 maths_fns/consistency_tests.py
 test_suite/consistency_tests.py
 sample_scripts/consistency_tests.py
 specific_fns/consistency_tests.py

Formating should be OK in these files except maybe for one thing for which

 I'm


 not sure. It's between lines 29 and 33 of prompt/consistency_tests.py where

 I


 don't know if the docstring should be below the line 'def __init__(self,
relax):' or below the line 'self.__relax_help__ = \' as it is now... Note

 that


 this is seen in many other code files...

 Hi,

Both patches have been applied to the repository. The patch
'patch_sample_scripts_consistency_tests' was committed at
r3331.
Change from 5000 to 500 simulations is reasonable. The large number
of simulations was because the calculation was so quick, but 500
should be more than sufficient. The addition of Grace plotting
functions to the Reduced Spectral Density Mapping sample script is
very useful and I will probably port this commit very soon to the 1.3
line. The patch 'patch_sample_scripts_jw_mapping' was
applied (at
r3332) directly to the 1.2 line rather than the
'consistency_tests_1.2' branch.

Cheers,

Edward

 I've tried cutting an pasting the patch but I get the following:

I don't know why, but thunderbird is destroying the attachment.

 The






 failed 'hunks' are the wrapped lines. Maybe there is a way to

 prevent






 thunderbird from doing this. Otherwise using another email client

 (or






 webmail) may work. I could also create a task for this consistency

for the record, the files are located within the permanent relax

 point











 numbers (just add '.0' to the end of the number), the

 of









 Grace plots as an output in the

 Hi,

I started working on implementing the consistency tests

 last



 week









 before


 the last post was made and, hence, I worked on repository

 line



 1.2








 (revision 3303).

I implemented the consistency tests as a new type of run

 ('ct')









 similar


 to the one for Jw mapping.

The calculations are made for J(0), F_eta and F_R2

 separately









 for each




 magnetic field (one at a time). The output results file

 is









 similar to




 the one for Jw mapping. The user then needs to plot them

 and









 look for




 consistency with its own criteria (calculation

 correlation












 coefficients, mean ratios and standard deviations, etc).

Please look at the followinr URL for a listing of the

 modifications to




 old files and also necessary new files.



<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://maple.rsvs.ulaval.ca/mediawiki/index.php/Relax_development">http://maple.rsvs.ulaval.ca/mediawiki/index.php/Relax_development</a>










 The file 'sample_scripts/consistency_tests.py' should be

 useful



 to








 understand how the new procedure works.

Even if this was done on repository line 1.2, I think it

 is









 quite fine




 since nothing was deleted but only things added (maybe

 too



 much,







 as I




 reproduced the Jw mapping approach, maybe too much as I

 added









 lines in




 the codes for grace, molmol, etc, maybe too much also

 since



 some









 code is


 duplicated from the Jw mapping code). The test-suite

 still



 works










 perfectly and, so, I think it could be fine to add the

 tests



 to



 the







 1.2


 line as well... However, if necessary, I could implement

 the











 consistency


 testing procedure on line 1.3, following your comments as

 I



 am









 quite new


 to Python and maybe made things somehow not perfectly...

Please tell me what you think about this.

 experiments and spectrometers using methanol (and

 always

 Therefore these tests would be quite useful. Data

 consistency



 is









 essential for the model-free results to be correct (as

 as









 reduced



 spectral density mapping, SRLS, etc.) as this affects

 both



 the











 optimisation and model selection and can result in

 artificial

 currently fit





 within relax. Maybe a new type of analysis should be

 created



 for







 this



 (see the pipe.create() user function in the 1.3 line or

 the













 run.create() user function in the 1.2 line). These

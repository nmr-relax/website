  Added a new system test for the direct optimisation of the paramagnetic 
centre.
........
  r11273 | bugman | 2010-07-02 10:41:41 +0200 (Fri, 02 Jul 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Renamed the pcs.centre() user function to paramag.centre() in the system 
tests.
  
  This is because in the future this paramagnetic centre position is shared 
with the PRE.
........
  r11274 | bugman | 2010-07-02 10:47:57 +0200 (Fri, 02 Jul 2010) | 6 lines
  
  Renamed the pcs.centre() user function to paramag.centre() to abstract for 
the PRE.
  
  The paramagnetic centre is shared between different NMR interactions, so 
this function has been
  abstracted and is no longer PCS dependent.
........
  r11275 | bugman | 2010-07-02 10:53:18 +0200 (Fri, 02 Jul 2010) | 3 lines
  
  The fix flag is now accepted by the paramag.centre() user function.

  Activated the paramag centre finding system test.
  
  This currently fails as the code to do this does not exist.
........
  r11280 | bugman | 2010-07-02 12:07:05 +0200 (Fri, 02 Jul 2010) | 3 lines
  
  Fixes for solely specifying that the paramag centre will be optimised.
........

  Fix for the RDC back_calc() function for when N=1 in the N-state model.
  
  The bond vector structure was not correct.
........
  r11282 | bugman | 2010-07-02 13:31:52 +0200 (Fri, 02 Jul 2010) | 6 lines
  
  Bug fix for the RDC back_calc() function - the align_id arg was being 
ignored.
  
  The RDCs were being calculated for all tensors, and then assigned to the 
align_id key.  The results
  was that the back-calculated RDCs were for the last tensor, not for 
align_id.
........
  r11283 | bugman | 2010-07-02 17:39:21 +0200 (Fri, 02 Jul 2010) | 9 lines
  
  Preparation for the optimisation of the paramagnetic centre in the N-state 
model.
  
  The calculation of PCS unit vectors and distances has been shifted into the 
new
  maths_fns.paramag_centre module and into the N-state model maths_fns code.  
The API of
  maths_fns.n_state_model has been changed so that now atomic positions, the 
paramagnetic centre
  position, the temperature, and frequency are passed in rather than the PCS 
vectors and constants.
  The code is now more flexible making it easy to add PRE support.
........
  r11284 | bugman | 2010-07-02 17:50:23 +0200 (Fri, 02 Jul 2010) | 3 lines
  
  The paramagnetic centre optimisation has been merged into the 
func_population() target function.

  r11285 | bugman | 2010-07-02 19:36:51 +0200 (Fri, 02 Jul 2010) | 5 lines
  
  The paramagnetic centre is now part of the parameter vector for the N-state 
model.
  
  Well, only when it is not fixed.
........
  r11286 | bugman | 2010-07-03 11:38:32 +0200 (Sat, 03 Jul 2010) | 5 lines
  
  N-state models with no parameters are now caught prior to optimisation.
  
  The minimise() method now simply throws a warning and returns without doing 
anything.
........
  r11287 | bugman | 2010-07-03 20:08:53 +0200 (Sat, 03 Jul 2010) | 3 lines
  
  The N-state model calculate() method now stored the back-calculated RDCs 
and PCSs and Q factors.
........
  r11288 | bugman | 2010-07-03 21:56:40 +0200 (Sat, 03 Jul 2010) | 3 lines

RDCs for all alignments.
........
  r11289 | bugman | 2010-07-06 18:10:10 +0200 (Tue, 06 Jul 2010) | 3 lines

  Docstring improvements - the geometric info should be in Angstroms.
........
  r11292 | bugman | 2010-07-08 11:49:35 +0200 (Thu, 08 Jul 2010) | 9 lines
  
  Better support for the optimisation and mapping of the Ln3+ position.
  
  The position is now treated in Angstrom, and is properly scaled.  A few 
additional API methods have
  been added for the mapping of the optimisation space, and a few modified to 
support the Ln3+
  position.
........
  r11293 | bugman | 2010-07-08 11:56:42 +0200 (Thu, 08 Jul 2010) | 3 lines
  
  Fix for the Ln3+ position optimisation with no populations, the target 
function was overwritten.
........
  r11294 | bugman | 2010-07-08 13:03:13 +0200 (Thu, 08 Jul 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Fix for the N-state model _assemble_scaling_matrix() method for the 
2-domain model.
  
  This is a recently introduced bug.  For the 2-domain model, no alignment 
parameters are optimised.
........
  r11295 | bugman | 2010-07-08 13:49:04 +0200 (Thu, 08 Jul 2010) | 3 lines
  
  Changed the alignment tensor parameter scaling back to 1 as this was 
slowing down the optimisation.

  Fix for the alignment tensor initialisation for when the ID is added to 
cdp.align_ids.
  
  This was introduced in r11301.  cdp.align_ids was not being checked if the 
align ID already exists.
........
  r11307 | bugman | 2010-07-15 17:23:28 +0200 (Thu, 15 Jul 2010) | 3 lines

  r11308 | bugman | 2010-07-15 18:32:33 +0200 (Thu, 15 Jul 2010) | 6 lines
  
  Small fixes and improvements to the rdc.back_calc() user function.
  
  Align IDs are being used instead of RDC IDs so RDCs can be back-calculated 
even if measured RDCs are
  not present.  And spin info is also being checked for better error 
reporting to the user.
........
  r11309 | bugman | 2010-07-15 18:34:04 +0200 (Thu, 15 Jul 2010) | 5 lines
  
  The RDC and PCS back-calculation user fns now add the alignment ID to the 
RDC and PCS if absent.
  
  Again this is to allow both data types to be back-calculated in the absence 
of measured data.
........
  r11310 | bugman | 2010-07-15 18:38:18 +0200 (Thu, 15 Jul 2010) | 3 lines

........
  r11320 | bugman | 2010-07-19 18:39:18 +0200 (Mon, 19 Jul 2010) | 6 lines
  
  Removal of the T23 transpose from compile_2nd_matrix_pseudo_ellipse() and 
an index shift of -1.
  
  The removal of the transpose has changed all of the indices in 
part_int_daeg2_pseudo_ellipse_xx().
  These indices now start at zero for easier debugging.

  Bug fix for the frame order grid search - the non-linear grid search is now 
performed.
  
  Previously the minfx.grid.grid() function was being used, causing the 
custom grid to be ignored.
  Now minfx.grid.grid_point_array() is being used allowing the non-regular 
grid to be used.

  Bug fix for the func_pseudo_ellipse() target function.
  
  The overwriting of the permanent storage data structures was killing the 
optimisation of the average
  domain position.  Now temporary data structures are used for the functions 
which return numpy arrays.
........
  r11335 | bugman | 2010-07-22 11:12:22 +0200 (Thu, 22 Jul 2010) | 5 lines

  The loading of RDCs and PCSs for non-existent spins now only throws a 
RelaxWarning.
  
  Rather than throwing a RelaxError, this allows for partial loading of 
alignment data for certain
  regions of the molecule.

  Removed the docstring length check from the code validator script and 
changed a printout.
  
  The docstring length is only 100 characters in the user functions.  For all 
other functions, no
  length is enforced.

  Created the torsionless pseudo-ellipse cone model, where the torsion angle 
simga is zero.
........
  r11389 | bugman | 2010-08-03 14:44:56 +0200 (Tue, 03 Aug 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Created the pseudo-ellipse, free rotor target function.
  
  This model is not yet available.

  r11390 | bugman | 2010-08-03 15:16:23 +0200 (Tue, 03 Aug 2010) | 3 lines
  
  Added the missing hyphen to 'pseudo ellipse' in the docstrings.
........
  r11391 | bugman | 2010-08-03 15:17:54 +0200 (Tue, 03 Aug 2010) | 3 lines
  
  Added target function aliases for all 12 parameteric restriction models of 
the pseudo-ellipse.

  The frame_order.select_model() user fn docstring now describes all 12 
parametric restriction models.
........
  r11393 | bugman | 2010-08-03 22:18:07 +0200 (Tue, 03 Aug 2010) | 6 lines
  
  Partial support for the 12 parametric restriction models of the 
pseudo-ellipse.
  
  All of the specific frame order code can now support these models.  The 
maths_fns code is still
  missing, so not all models are available.
........
  r11394 | bugman | 2010-08-03 22:37:46 +0200 (Tue, 03 Aug 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Shifted all of the shared code in the frame order target functions to 
reduce_and_rot().
  
  This significantly simplifies the code base and removes a large source of 
bugs.
........
  r11395 | bugman | 2010-08-03 22:48:06 +0200 (Tue, 03 Aug 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Abstracted the common code in compile_2nd_matrix_*() into rotate_daeg().
  
  This will significantly simplify the addition of all of the 12 models.
........
  r11396 | bugman | 2010-08-03 23:02:21 +0200 (Tue, 03 Aug 2010) | 6 lines
  
  Simplified compile_2nd_matrix_iso_cone() by using rotate_daeg().
  
  The compile_2nd_matrix_*() functions now build the rotation matrix 
themselves as this is not shared
  code.
........
  r11397 | bugman | 2010-08-03 23:09:43 +0200 (Tue, 03 Aug 2010) | 3 lines
  
  Fix for the reduce_and_rot() method, the self arg was missing.

  Simplified and sped up the torsionless pseudo ellipse.
  
  6 functions, and hence 6 numerical integrations, have been deleted as they 
are repetitive of other
  frame order matrix elements.

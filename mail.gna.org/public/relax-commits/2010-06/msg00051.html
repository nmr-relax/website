........
  r10879 | bugman | 2010-02-24 00:12:17 +0100 (Wed, 24 Feb 2010) | 6 lines
  
  Expanded the references to include a number of new variables.
  
  These include 'type', 'status', 'journal_full', and 'author2'.  These will 
be used mainly in the
  BMRB branch.
........
  r10881 | bugman | 2010-02-24 00:37:37 +0100 (Wed, 24 Feb 2010) | 3 lines
  
  Added defaults values of None for the ref class variables.

  Addition of the relax status singleton object.
  
  See <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nmr-relax.com/mail.gna.org/public/relax-devel/2010-01/msg00094.html">https://mail.gna.org/public/relax-devel/2010-01/msg00094.html</a> and other 
related posts in the
  thread.
  
  The idea is that various parts of relax deposit status information into 
here that other parts of
  relax can then use.  For example the Monte Carlo code can place the current 
simulation number in
  there while the relax GUI controller can read these values.
........
  r10938 | bugman | 2010-02-25 13:52:35 +0100 (Thu, 25 Feb 2010) | 6 lines
  
  The Monte Carlo simulation number is now present in the status singleton.
  
  The value of status.mc_number is set to the simulation number (starting at 
0) and at the end is
  reset to None.
........
  r10939 | bugman | 2010-02-25 14:37:11 +0100 (Thu, 25 Feb 2010) | 11 lines
  
  All of the relevant status information about the dAuvergne_protocol 
auto-analysis is being stored.
  
  This includes:
      status.dAuvergne_protocol.diff_model = None        # The global 
diffusion model.
      status.dAuvergne_protocol.round = None             # The round of 
optimisation, i.e. the global iteration.
      status.dAuvergne_protocol.mf_models = None         # The list of 
model-free models for optimisation, i.e. the global iteration.
      status.dAuvergne_protocol.local_mf_models = None   # The list of 
model-free local tm models for optimisation, i.e. the global iteration.
      status.dAuvergne_protocol.current_model = None     # The current 
model-free model.
      status.dAuvergne_protocol.convergence = False      # The convergence of 
the global model.

  r10940 | bugman | 2010-02-25 14:59:08 +0100 (Thu, 25 Feb 2010) | 7 lines
  
  Bug fix and updates to the generic_fns.angles.wrap_angles() function.
  
  This was not wrapping correctly when the window was not between 0 and 2pi.  
Epydoc tags have been
  added to the docstring, the window size can now be specified and is checked 
against the bounds as a
  sanity check, and comments have been added all over.
........
  r10941 | bugman | 2010-02-25 15:15:09 +0100 (Thu, 25 Feb 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Fix for a bug introduced in the last revision (r10940).
  
  This affects the spherical angles used to define the spheroidal diffusion 
tensor major axis.
........
  r10942 | bugman | 2010-02-25 15:16:53 +0100 (Thu, 25 Feb 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Added a new function fold_spherical_angles() for removing symmetry from 
spherical angles.
  
  This will be useful for future use of these angles.
........
  r10943 | bugman | 2010-02-25 15:19:38 +0100 (Thu, 25 Feb 2010) | 5 lines
  
  The fold_spherical_angles() performs a second wrapping in case the angles 
shift out of the window.
  
  Window size checks have also been added.
........
  r10944 | bugman | 2010-02-25 15:25:02 +0100 (Thu, 25 Feb 2010) | 5 lines

........
  r10947 | bugman | 2010-02-25 16:37:43 +0100 (Thu, 25 Feb 2010) | 7 lines
  
  Removed the iteration count check in the test_opt_rigid_rand_rot() system 
test.
  
  This number is different on a PowerPC chip with Mac OS X, even if the 
parameter values are
  identical.  This was identified by Jack Howarth (howarth att bromo dot med 
dot uc dot edu) in the
  post <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nmr-relax.com/mail.gna.org/public/relax-users/2010-02/msg00025.html">https://mail.gna.org/public/relax-users/2010-02/msg00025.html</a>.

  Partially removed the need for Fink specific modifications.
  
  This removes the need for the patch given by Jack Howarth &lt;howarth att 
bromo dot med dot uc dot edu&gt;
  in the message 
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nmr-relax.com/mail.gna.org/public/relax-users/2010-02/msg00031.html">https://mail.gna.org/public/relax-users/2010-02/msg00031.html</a>.
  
  A similar python specific path was being used to find Python.h on all 
architectures, so the include
  path was copied and modified to be a bin path.
........
  r10949 | bugman | 2010-03-09 11:06:06 +0100 (Tue, 09 Mar 2010) | 6 lines
  
  Bug fix for the N-state model cone PDB creation _cone_pdb() method.
  
  The internal structural API had changed.  structure.add_struct() is now 
called
  structure.add_molecule().
........

  Removed the pipe test from the pymol.cone_pdb() user function.
  
  This check is not necessary as a data pipe is not needed for this.
........
  r10952 | bugman | 2010-03-09 11:44:48 +0100 (Tue, 09 Mar 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Added a new module for holding class objects defining different cone types.
  
  This currently contains the Iso_cone class with the simple method phi_max() 
to return the cone edge.
........
  r10953 | bugman | 2010-03-09 11:50:48 +0100 (Tue, 09 Mar 2010) | 5 lines
  
  The cone_edge() method now calls a function to obtain the maximum polar 
angle.
  
  The cone_edge() arg 'angle' has been changed to 'phi_max_fn'.
........
  r10954 | bugman | 2010-03-09 11:51:38 +0100 (Tue, 09 Mar 2010) | 3 lines
  
  The frame order and N-state model cone_pdb() methods now use the isotropic 
cone object.

a point is inside or not.
........
  r10957 | bugman | 2010-03-09 19:11:18 +0100 (Tue, 09 Mar 2010) | 7 lines
  
  Converted generate_vector_dist() to use a limit checking function and 
simplified the code.
  
  The angle arrays are now returned by uniform_vect_dist_spherical_angles() 
so that
  generate_vector_dist() can use any spherical point distribution.  The 
max_angle arg has been changed
  to limit_check so that any type of vector distribution can be created.
........
  r10958 | bugman | 2010-03-09 19:23:46 +0100 (Tue, 09 Mar 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Shifted the calculation of the uniform sphere point positions into 
angles_uniform().
  
  This removes this replicated code from various functions, allowing for more 
flexibility.
........
  r10961 | bugman | 2010-03-10 10:07:35 +0100 (Wed, 10 Mar 2010) | 3 lines

  r10963 | bugman | 2010-03-10 17:33:53 +0100 (Wed, 10 Mar 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Shifted the model-free _back_calc() method into the analysis specific API 
as back_calc_ri().
  
  This is now being called by the relax_data.back_calc() user function.
........
  r10964 | bugman | 2010-03-10 17:38:17 +0100 (Wed, 10 Mar 2010) | 3 lines

........
  r10965 | bugman | 2010-03-10 17:39:33 +0100 (Wed, 10 Mar 2010) | 6 lines
  
  Fixes for the back_calc() method.
  
  The find_index() function was already defined (so renamed to 
find_ri_index()), and the analysis
  specific API back_calc_ri() method was incorrectly called.
........
  r10966 | bugman | 2010-03-10 18:02:28 +0100 (Wed, 10 Mar 2010) | 3 lines
  
  Comment fixes - relax handles spins, not residues now.
........
  r10967 | bugman | 2010-03-10 18:27:06 +0100 (Wed, 10 Mar 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Fix for the back_calc_ri() API method.

  Bug fix for back_calc_ri()!
  
  The bug was introduced at r10967.  The check for missing data was not 
performing correctly, causing
  the Monte Carlo simulations to be stuck in an infinite loop!
........
  r10984 | bugman | 2010-03-12 11:55:46 +0100 (Fri, 12 Mar 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Bug fix for the generate_vector_dist() function.

  r10987 | bugman | 2010-03-12 19:45:37 +0100 (Fri, 12 Mar 2010) | 7 lines
  
  Started to redesign the generic_fns.pymol module to use the pymol python 
package.
  
  This involves much renaming of the PyMOL pipe object which is not the PyMOL 
executable object.  This
  attempts to use the pymol python package, and if not available PyMOL will 
be run from the command
  line as a pipe.
........
  r10988 | bugman | 2010-03-12 19:49:27 +0100 (Fri, 12 Mar 2010) | 3 lines

  Redesigned the ImportErrorTestCase class so that the test failure clearly 
explains what went wrong.
  
  The traceback is now stored and later printed, the exception is not passed 
in, rather strings with
  the module name and traceback, and comments and docstrings have been added.
........
  r11000 | bugman | 2010-03-15 14:48:49 +0100 (Mon, 15 Mar 2010) | 7 lines
  
  Copied the relax installation path into __main__.install_path.
  
  The import of the PyMOL clobbered sys.path!!!  Therefore relax does not 
touch this array any more.
  Instead __main__.install_path is used to store where relax is installed.  
This should avoid all
  problems with sys.path.

  Fix for the docstring fetching script.
  
  The relax prompt interface is no longer run as the user functions are 
directly located in the
  _locals private dictionary.
........
  r11007 | bugman | 2010-03-16 01:43:32 +0100 (Tue, 16 Mar 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Converted the user function exec_info object to be private.
  
  This was bad in 2 ways, it was visible to the user and it was killing the 
fetch_docstring.py script.
........
  r11008 | bugman | 2010-03-16 01:52:03 +0100 (Tue, 16 Mar 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Fixes for some error messages in fetch_docstrings.py.
  
  This should have been writing to stderr, not sys!
........
  r11009 | bugman | 2010-03-16 01:55:36 +0100 (Tue, 16 Mar 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Removed the epydoc tags from the on() and off() methods.
  
  These are user functions, and the tags were killing fetch_docstrings.py.

  Temporary set up the svnmerge properties to merge the bieri_gui branch back 
into the 1.3 line.
  
  The command used was:
  svnmerge.py init svn+ssh://bugman@xxxxxxxxxxx/svn/relax/branches/bieri_gui
  
  This will be used solely to test if this branch can be merged.

  Reverted r11004 as this, for some unknown reason, undid the changes of 
r11001.
  
  The command used was:
  svn merge -r11004:11003 .

  Bug fix for the minimisation user functions.
  
  This was introduced accidentally in r11007.  The reference self._exec_info 
was accidentally set to
  self.__exec_info.

  Reverted r9348 as this breaks on Mac OS X newline characters!!!!  Retarded 
python 3.0!
  
  The command used was:
  [edau@localhost relax-1.3]$ svn merge -r9348:9347 .
  --- Reverse-merging r9348 into '.':
  U    prompt/interpreter.py

    Changed paths:
       M /1.3/prompt/interpreter.py
  
    The execfile statement has been replaced with a call to the 
exec(compile()) function.
  
    This was done with the python 2.x to 3.x script with the commands:
    2to3 -w -f exec relax .
  
    The change is in preparation for Python 3.0, and relax still works with 
Python versions 2.4, 2.5,
    and 2.6.  The syntax has changed from:
  
    execfile(script_file, local)
  
    to:
  
    exec(compile(open(script_file).read(), script_file, 'exec'), local)
  
    Hmmm, not much of a language simplification!

  Fix for the ellipsoid() function for the new param_types == 3 (Dxx, Dyy, 
Dzz, Dxy, Dxz, Dyz) data.
  
  The ordering Dx &lt;= Dy &lt;= Dz was not being used so the rhombicity was 
incorrectly calculated.

  r11016 | bugman | 2010-03-16 18:42:07 +0100 (Tue, 16 Mar 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Another bug fix for the ellipsoid() function for the (Dxx, Dyy, Dzz, Dxy, 
Dxz, Dyz) parameter set.
  
  The Euler angles which were in radians were being converted from deg to 
rad!!!

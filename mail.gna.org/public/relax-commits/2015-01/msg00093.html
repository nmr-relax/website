  r27185 | bugman | 2015-01-15 09:26:49 +0100 (Thu, 15 Jan 2015) | 3 lines
  
  Updated my copyright notice on all files changed in 2015.
........
  r27186 | bugman | 2015-01-15 09:37:14 +0100 (Thu, 15 Jan 2015) | 3 lines
  
  Updated the main relax copyright notices for 2015.
........
  r27187 | bugman | 2015-01-15 09:39:46 +0100 (Thu, 15 Jan 2015) | 7 lines
  
  The copyright notice in the GUI now uses the info box object.
  
  This is for the status bar at the bottom of the GUI window.  This removes 
one place where copyright
  notices needs to be updated each year.  This status text will then be 
updated whenever the info.py
  file has been updated.
........
  r27188 | bugman | 2015-01-15 09:42:02 +0100 (Thu, 15 Jan 2015) | 3 lines
  
  Updated the copyright notice for 2015 in the GUI splash screen graphic.
........
  r27189 | bugman | 2015-01-15 09:54:55 +0100 (Thu, 15 Jan 2015) | 7 lines
  
  Racing fixes for the General.test_bug_23187_residue_delete_gui GUI test.
  
  Some GUI interpreter flush() calls have been added to avoid racing in the 
GUI.  The GUI tests are so
  quick that the asynchronous user function call will be processed at the 
same time as the spin viewer
  window is being created, causing fatal segmentation faults in the test 
suite.
........
  r27190 | bugman | 2015-01-15 10:15:50 +0100 (Thu, 15 Jan 2015) | 10 lines
  
  More robustness for the spin viewer GUI window prune_*() methods.
  
  When no spin data exists, the self.tree.GetItemPyData(key) call can return 
None.  This is now being
  checked for and such None values are being skipped in the prune_mol(), 
prune_res() and prune_spin()
  methods.
  
  The problem was found in the Mf.test_bug_20479_gui_final_pipe system test 
when running the command:
  for i in {1..10}; do ./relax --gui-tests --time -d &amp;&gt;&gt; gui_tests.log; done

  When no spin data exists, the self.tree.GetItemPyData(key) call can return 
None.  This is now being
  checked for and such None values are being skipped in the update_mol(), 
update_res() and
  update_spin() methods.

  More robustness for the spin viewer GUI window prune_*() methods.
  
  The data returned from the self.tree.GetItemPyData(key) call can in rare 
racing cases not contain
  the 'id' key.  This is now being checked for and are being skipped in the 
prune_mol(), prune_res()
  and prune_spin() methods.

  r27194 | bugman | 2015-01-15 14:00:18 +0100 (Thu, 15 Jan 2015) | 5 lines
  
  Created a development document for catching segfaults and other errors in 
the GUI tests.
  
  This is needed as not all wxPython errors can be caught in the Python 
unittest framework.
........
  r27195 | bugman | 2015-01-16 11:44:22 +0100 (Fri, 16 Jan 2015) | 3 lines

  Improvements for the plots created by the pcs.corr_plot user function.

reasonable values.
........
  r27197 | bugman | 2015-01-16 17:33:56 +0100 (Fri, 16 Jan 2015) | 6 lines
  
  Fix for the rdc.corr_plot user function.
  
  The Y-axis is now set to the measured RDC, as the RDC errors are plotted as 
dY errors.  This matches
  the behaviour of the pcs.corr_plot user function.
........
  r27198 | bugman | 2015-01-16 18:38:10 +0100 (Fri, 16 Jan 2015) | 3 lines

determined by the data.

  Reverted range of commits r27213:r27202 as this was a bad implementation.
  
  To get the distribution, one should look at the sum of squares.
  But this should be from the weighted sum of squares, which is stored as 
chi2.
  The API provides a method of model_statistics(), to get:
      k - number of parameters.
      n - number of data points.
      chi2 - the chi-squared value.
  
  Then reduced chi2 can be computed. chi2_red = chi2/(n-k)
  And the error distribution be drawn from this.
  
  The command used was:
  svn merge -r27213:r27201 .

  Extended the user function 'monte_carlo.create_data', to allow for the 
defition of the STD to use in gauss distribution.
  
  This is for creation of Monte-Carlo simulations, where one has perhaps 
gained information about the expected errors of the datapoints, which is not 
measured.

  In backend pipe_control.error_analysis.monte_carlo_create_data() added the 
argument 'fixed_error' to allow for fixed input of error to the gauss 
distribution.
  
  Inserted a range of checks, to make sure function behaves as expected.

  Added a RelaxWarning printout to the dep_check module if wxPython 2.8 or 
less is encountered.
  
  This follows from 
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.devel/7502">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.devel/7502</a>.  The warning text 
is
  simply written to STDERR as relax starts.

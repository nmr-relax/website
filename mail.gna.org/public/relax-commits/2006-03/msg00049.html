+\section{Committing conventions}
+
+If you are a relax developer and you have commit access to the repository, 
the following conventions should be followed.
+
+
+% Format of the commit logs.
+\subsection{Format of the commit logs}
+
+The length of all lines in the commit log should never exceed 100 
characters.  This is so that the log message viewed in either emails or by 
the command prompt command \texttt{svn log} is legible.  The first line of 
the commit log should be a short description or synopsis of the changes.  The 
second line should be blank.
+
+If the commit is a bug fix reported by someone else or if the commit 
originates from a patch posted by someone else, the next lines should be 
reserved for crediting.  The name of the person and their obfusicated email 
address (for example edward at nmr-relax.com) should be included in the 
message.
+
+If the commit relates to an entry in the bug tracker or to a discussion on 
the mailing lists, then the web address of either the bug report or the 
mailing list archive message should be cited in the next section (separated 
from the synopsis or credit section by a blank line).  All relevant links 
should be included to allow easy navigation between the repository, mailing 
lists, bug tracker, etc.
+
+A full description containing all the details can follow.  This description 
should follow a blank line, can itself be sectioned using blank lines, and 
finally the log is terminated by one blank line at the end of the message.

+\section{Making changes}
+
+
+% Patching.
+\subsection{Patching}
+
+Fixes and improvements to the relax source code can be posted to the 
relax-devel mailing list in the form of a patch.  The modified sources need 
be a checked out version of the one of the directories in the relax 
repository.  Prior to submitting a patch to the mailing list, your sources 
should be updated to include the most recent changes.  To do this, type
+
+\example{\$ svn up}
+
+and note the revision number.  The update may cause a conflict if changes 
added to the repository clash with your modifications.  If this occurs, see 
the Subversion book at 
\href{<a  href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/}{http://svnbook.red-bean.com/}">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/}{http://svnbook.red-bean.com/}</a> for details 
on how to resolve the conflict.
+
+Once the sources are up to date, your changes can be can be converted into a 
text file called a patch.  Using SVN, creating a patch is easy.  Just type
+
+\example{\$ svn diff &gt; patch}
+
+and then send the file `patch' to the ``relax-devel at gna.org'' mailing 
list.  The patch is simply the output of the Unix diff command in the unified 
format.  Make sure you label in your post which revision the patch is for.  
Also try to create a commit log message according to the format described 
above for one of the relax committers to copy and possibly modify.
+
+
+% Becoming a committer.
+\subsection{Becoming a committer}
+
+After proving oneself, anyone can become a relax developer and obtain commit 
access to the relax repository.  The main criteria for selection by the relax 
developers is to show good judgement, competence in producing good patches, 
compliance with the coding and commit log conventions, comportment on the 
mailing lists, not producing too many bugs, only taking on challenges which 
can be handled, and the skill in judging your own abilities.  After a number 
of patches have been submitted and accepted, any of the relax developers can 
propose that you receive commit access.  If a number of developers agree 
while no one says no, then commit access will be offered.
+
+One area where coding ability can be demonstrated is within the relax test 
suite.  The addition of tests, especially those where the relax internal data 
structures of \texttt{self.relax.data} are scrutinised, can be a good 
starting point for learning the structure of relax.  The beauty of the tests 
are that the introduction of bugs has no effect on normal program executiong. 
 The relax test suite is an ideal proving ground.
+
+If skills in only certain areas of relax development, for example in 
creation of the documentation, an understanding of C but not python, an 
understanding of solely the code of the user interface, or an understanding 
of the code specific to a certain type of data analysis methodology, then 
partial commit access may be granted.  Although you will have the ablity to 
make modifications to any part of the repository, please make modifications 
only those areas for which you have permission.

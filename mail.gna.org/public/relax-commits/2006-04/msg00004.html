-For classes, relax uses a mix of camel case (for example all the 
\texttt{RelaxError} objects) and underscores (for example 
\texttt{Model\_free}).  The first letter in all cases is always capitalised.  
Generally the camel case is reserved for very low level classes which are 
involved in the program's infrastructure.  Examples include the RelaxError 
code, the threading code, and the \texttt{self.relax.data} code.  All the 
data analysis specific code, generic code, interface code, etc. uses 
underscores between the words with only the first letter capitalised.  One 
exception is the space mapping class \texttt{OpenDX}, the reason being that 
the program is called `OpenDX'.

 The preferred method for submitting fixes and improvements to the relax 
source code is by the creation of a patch.  If your changes are a fix, make 
sure you have submitted a bug report to the bug tracker located at 
\href{<a  href="https://gna.org/bugs/?group=relax}{https://gna.org/bugs/?group=relax}">https://gna.org/bugs/?group=relax}{https://gna.org/bugs/?group=relax}</a> 
first.  See section~\ref{reporting bugs} on page~\pageref{reporting bugs} for 
more details.  Two methods can be used to generate the patch, either using 
the Unix command \texttt{diff} or using the Subversion program.  The 
resultant file \texttt{patch} of either the \texttt{diff} or \texttt{svn} 
command described below can be posted to the ``relax-devel at gna.org'' 
mailing list.  Please label within your post which version of relax you 
modified or which revision the patch is for.  Also try to create a commit log 
message according to the format described in section~\ref{commit log format} 
on page~\pageref{commit log format} for one of the relax committers to use as 
a template for committing the change.

 If your modifications have been made to the source code of one of the 
official relax releases (for example 1.2.2), then the Unix command 
\texttt{diff} can be used to create a patch.  A patch file is simply the 
output of the diff command used recursively and presented in the `unified' 
format.  Therefore two directories need to be compared.  If the original 
sources are located in the directory \texttt{relax\_orig} and the modified 
sources in \texttt{relax\_mod}, then the patch can be created by typing
 
 \example{\$ diff -ur relax\_orig relax\_mod &gt; patch}

 If possible, changes to the latest sources is preferred.  Using the most up 
to date sources from the relax SVN repository will significantly aid the 
relax developers to incorporate your changes back into the main development 
line.  To check out the current development line, see section~\ref{svn 
repository} on page~\pageref{svn repository} for details.  Prior to 
submitting a patch to the mailing list, your sources should be updated to 
include the most recent changes.  To do this, type

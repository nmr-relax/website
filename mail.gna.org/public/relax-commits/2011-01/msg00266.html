  Fix for the relatively unused calc_tensor_diag() for oblate tensors.
  
  The eigenvalues were incorrectly ordered for oblate spheroids.
................
  r11664 | bugman | 2010-11-17 15:04:52 +0100 (Wed, 17 Nov 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Fix for a failing diffusion tensor unit test.
  
  This was testing an unused element of the diffusion tensor data structure 
incorrectly.
................
  r11665 | bugman | 2010-11-17 16:03:54 +0100 (Wed, 17 Nov 2010) | 5 lines
  
  The rotation matrix for the spheroidal diffusion tensors is now correctly 
generated.
  
  Again this is a fix for currently unused code (it will be used for BMRB 
support though).

  Removed some debugging code.
................
  r11668 | bugman | 2010-11-17 16:45:32 +0100 (Wed, 17 Nov 2010) | 3 lines
  
  Some rotation matrix check fixes for the diffusion tensor unit tests.
................
  r11669 | bugman | 2010-11-17 16:48:20 +0100 (Wed, 17 Nov 2010) | 3 lines
  
  Dpar_unit is no longer passed into calc_rotation() for spheroidal 
diffusion, as it is not needed.
................
  r11670 | bugman | 2010-11-17 17:01:24 +0100 (Wed, 17 Nov 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Fix for the updating of the rotation and tensor MC sim objects for the 
spheroidal diffusion.
  
  This problem was only recently introduced.
................
  r11671 | bugman | 2010-11-17 17:05:46 +0100 (Wed, 17 Nov 2010) | 3 lines
  
  Similar fix as in r11670, but for setting MC sim data.
................
  r11672 | bugman | 2010-11-17 17:18:29 +0100 (Wed, 17 Nov 2010) | 3 lines
  
  Some more fixes for handling the diffusion tensor data structure 
'spheroid_type' variable properly.
................
  r11673 | bugman | 2010-11-17 19:14:57 +0100 (Wed, 17 Nov 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Fix for the creation of the oblate spheroid geometric object PDB file.
  
  The x and z axes need to be swapped now for the oblate tensor.
................
  r11674 | bugman | 2010-11-17 19:23:43 +0100 (Wed, 17 Nov 2010) | 6 lines
  
  For some reason, the diffusion tensor PDB file for the oblate tensor now 
has a slight rotation.
  
  This rotation is about the unique axis of the tensor, so this gives a 
different PDB file, but the
  representation is the same.
................
  r11675 | bugman | 2010-11-18 13:42:02 +0100 (Thu, 18 Nov 2010) | 3 lines
  
  Some small cosmetic changes to the spheroid diffusion tensor system tests.
................
  r11676 | bugman | 2010-11-18 13:51:23 +0100 (Thu, 18 Nov 2010) | 3 lines
  
  The hardcoded variables in get_spheroid() are now keyword args.
................
  r11677 | bugman | 2010-11-18 14:03:01 +0100 (Thu, 18 Nov 2010) | 3 lines

diffusion tensor.
................
  r11678 | bugman | 2010-11-18 16:52:49 +0100 (Thu, 18 Nov 2010) | 6 lines
  
  Fix for the spheroid diffusion tensors for a recently introduced bug.
  
  The oblate and prolate check was failing as the 'spheroid_type' variable 
was set to None after a
  call to diffusion_tensor.init().  'spheroid_type' is now automatically 
updated if Da is changed.
................
  r11679 | bugman | 2010-11-18 17:08:23 +0100 (Thu, 18 Nov 2010) | 5 lines
  
  The tensor is first twisted before rotating to PDB frame in the spheroid 
diffusion tensor system tests.
  
  The twisting rotation was not being correctly performed.
................
  r11680 | bugman | 2010-11-18 17:25:40 +0100 (Thu, 18 Nov 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Renamed test_init_spheroid_as_ellipsoid() to 
test_init_prolate_spheroid_as_ellipsoid().
  
  The print outs of the system test have been slightly improved.
................
  r11681 | bugman | 2010-11-18 17:38:09 +0100 (Thu, 18 Nov 2010) | 3 lines

checks into a separate method.
................
  r11682 | bugman | 2010-11-18 18:20:02 +0100 (Thu, 18 Nov 2010) | 3 lines
  
  Added a new system test test_init_oblate_spheroid_as_ellipsoid().
................
  r11683 | bugman | 2010-11-18 18:25:51 +0100 (Thu, 18 Nov 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Fix for the ellipsoid eigenvalue and rotation matrix reordering for when 2 
eigenvalues are the same.
  
  This only affects the (Dxx, Dyy, Dzz, Dxy, Dxz, Dyz) parameter input into 
diffusion_tensor.init().
................
  r11684 | bugman | 2010-11-18 18:29:29 +0100 (Thu, 18 Nov 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Fix for the eigenvalue and rotation matrix sorting for (Dxx, Dyy, Dzz, Dxy, 
Dxz, Dyz).
  
  The eigenvalues were being converted to ints!
................
  r11685 | bugman | 2010-11-18 18:53:39 +0100 (Thu, 18 Nov 2010) | 6 lines
  
  Final bug fix for the input of (Dxx, Dyy, Dzz, Dxy, Dxz, Dyz) ellipsoidal 
diffusion parameters.
  
  The numpy eigenvalue decomposition has been replaced by SVD as the 
eigenvalue decomposition could
  generate a proper rotation matrix when 2 eigenvalues are the same.  The 
test suite now passes fully.
................
  r11688 | bugman | 2010-11-19 14:46:34 +0100 (Fri, 19 Nov 2010) | 3 lines
  
  Improved the diffusion tensor print out.
................
  r11758 | bugman | 2010-12-10 16:27:22 +0100 (Fri, 10 Dec 2010) | 3 lines
  
  The molecule type can now be specified.
................
  r11801 | bugman | 2010-12-13 23:51:44 +0100 (Mon, 13 Dec 2010) | 5 lines
  
  The molecule_loop() and residue_loop() methods now accept the return_id 
flag.
  
  The molecule or residue ID strings are now returned when requested.
................
  r11811 | bugman | 2010-12-14 11:11:03 +0100 (Tue, 14 Dec 2010) | 8 lines
  
  Added a system test for bug #17276.
  
  This bug (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?17276">https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?17276</a>) was reported by Leanne 
Minall &lt;lm7902 att bristol
  dot ac dott uk&gt;.
  
  The test passes though as the problem is not in this test data.
................
  r11812 | bugman | 2010-12-14 11:23:31 +0100 (Tue, 14 Dec 2010) | 3 lines
  
  Bug #17276 is now triggered in the system test.
................
  r11817 | bugman | 2010-12-14 18:22:33 +0100 (Tue, 14 Dec 2010) | 6 lines
  
  Removed some checks in the generic_fns.mol_res_spin.molecule_loop() 
function which was triggering bugs.
  
  The old checking code is of no use, as all types of molecule IDs should be 
accepted!  This only
  recently became an issue for some unknown reason?!?!
................
  r11820 | bugman | 2010-12-14 23:47:05 +0100 (Tue, 14 Dec 2010) | 7 lines
  
  An execution lock has been added to the status object.
  
  This allows parts of relax to prevent others from running, which is 
especially useful in certain
  UIs.  A special Exec_lock class object has been created to simulate a 
proper threading.Lock object,
  but with certain additional features.
................
  r11821 | bugman | 2010-12-14 23:47:33 +0100 (Tue, 14 Dec 2010) | 3 lines

  r11826 | bugman | 2010-12-15 01:33:13 +0100 (Wed, 15 Dec 2010) | 5 lines
  
  The Mf.bug_14941_local_tm_global_selection system test now prints out some 
status info.
  
  This is to test the status container.
................
  r11827 | bugman | 2010-12-15 01:35:28 +0100 (Wed, 15 Dec 2010) | 5 lines
  
  Fixes for the status object by renaming __init__() to setup() and calling 
it only once.
  
  The object was not acting as a singleton because of the presence of 
__init__().  This is now fixed.
................
  r11828 | bugman | 2010-12-15 01:36:05 +0100 (Wed, 15 Dec 2010) | 3 lines
  
  The status object is being initialised and setup before execution of the 
main relax class.
................
  r11829 | bugman | 2010-12-15 01:36:48 +0100 (Wed, 15 Dec 2010) | 3 lines
  
  The status object is not being initialised on import, to allow controlled 
setup upon start up.
................
  r11830 | bugman | 2010-12-15 01:45:19 +0100 (Wed, 15 Dec 2010) | 6 lines
  
  Security fix - execfile() is no longer used to run relax scripts.
  
  Instead a custom function exec_script() is being used to call 
runpy.run_module().  exec_script()
  also locks and releases the relax execution lock before and after operation.
................
  r11831 | bugman | 2010-12-15 09:41:27 +0100 (Wed, 15 Dec 2010) | 3 lines
  
  The execution lock is released by the interpreter in all Error situations.
................
  r11837 | bugman | 2010-12-16 11:52:56 +0100 (Thu, 16 Dec 2010) | 6 lines
  
  The debugging flag now disables the execution locking mechanism.
  
  The acquire() and release() calls are also recorded in the 'lock.log' file 
to help with lock
  debugging.
................
  r11838 | bugman | 2010-12-16 11:53:51 +0100 (Thu, 16 Dec 2010) | 3 lines
  
  Missing module import.
................
  r11839 | bugman | 2010-12-16 11:56:02 +0100 (Thu, 16 Dec 2010) | 3 lines
  
  Shifted the initialisation of the status object to be after the 
__main__.debug initialisation.
................
  r11840 | bugman | 2010-12-16 12:17:36 +0100 (Thu, 16 Dec 2010) | 5 lines
  
  The system and unit tests are placing their names into the status object.
  
  This will be used for debugging.
................
  r11841 | bugman | 2010-12-16 12:18:14 +0100 (Thu, 16 Dec 2010) | 3 lines

  r11842 | bugman | 2010-12-16 12:37:36 +0100 (Thu, 16 Dec 2010) | 3 lines
  
  The execution lock mechanism no longer blocks scripts from running within 
scripts.
................
  r11843 | bugman | 2010-12-16 12:49:07 +0100 (Thu, 16 Dec 2010) | 3 lines
  
  Nested scripts no longer acquire the execution lock.
................

  Fix for the execution locking when an auto-analysis is launched from a

script, just as it is
  for nested scripting.

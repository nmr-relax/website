<pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi,

again see below:


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">One strategy to overcome this was to
* record a HSQC/TROSY at different temperatures at the different 
spectrometers
 (conveniently by using Brukers multi_zgvt),
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Did you use the trosy experiment for relaxation measurements?
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Yes, that's why I'm asking. ;)

I have the impression that the methanol method is not always perfectly 
reflecting the situation in an aqueous buffer with all kinds of salts in 
it, and that the huge methanol signals and the resulting radiation damping 
can make determination of the &quot;true&quot; MeOH peak maxima pretty difficult. 
They seem pretty broad to me. The maximum resolution of peak distance I can 
get with Topspin is 0.02 ppm, and if I consider that 0.02 ppm already makes 
a difference of ~ 1 K I guess there is the possibility of significant 
error. We tried using deuterated methanol at atmospheric pressure (much 
less intense signal, sharper peaks, no boiling point artifacts due to odd 
pressures in a sealed tube) to see if there are any differences to our 
standard procedure with protonated MeOH, but I couldn't see any.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

For the temperature issues, maybe it is worth talking to the Bruker
people.  They would know the best.  But from my fading memory, I
believe MeOH is useful for temperatures &lt; 300 K whereas ethylene
glycol is for &gt; 300 K.  Your issues might arise from methanol
volatility.  The different induction and radiation dampening of the
standard samples and your NMR sample is an issue, but there is a lot
of literature on this that might help you.  Again this is ancient
memory for me, so you will have to find the articles yourself.  There
are many different ways for calibrating the temperature.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">To make matters worse, we have four solution spectrometers with Bruker 
cryoprobes and one usually used with a room temperature probe, and of 
course each and avery probe has a different design in the temperature unit. 
It's not hard to start believing that every machine is behaving completely 
differently.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Every spectrometer behaves differently with respect to temperature, so
temperature calibration is essential for any serious dynamics study.
It is incorrect and dangerous to assume that the VT temperature
setting is the same as the sample temperature.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">To make my point clear I made two figures.

The following plot shows a series of spectra, which all have the same 
reference frequency. You can see that most signals are shifting, into 
different &quot;directions&quot;. One exception is the (alanine) signal at 134 / 9.2 
ppm, which is pretty stable over a range of 5 K. The series is color coded 
red = 305 K to purple = 310 K according to the usual methanol calibration.

<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4019316/temp-750-zoom.pdf">https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4019316/temp-750-zoom.pdf</a>

Now after adding another spectrum from a different spectrometer (in 
magenta, it's also a different sample in this case) I first have the 
problem of proper referencing, as I don't know if the diverging signal 
positions are a result of slightly inaccurate field calibrations or due to 
different temperatures. I referenced it to the said Ala signal which seems 
to be unimpressed by temperature changes.

The &quot;magenta spectrum&quot; should correspond to one of the spectra &quot;in the 
middle&quot;, namely 307 K, but in reality it fits the 310 K spectrum much, much 
better.

<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4019316/temp-750-reference.pdf">https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4019316/temp-750-reference.pdf</a>

What do you think? Isn't it odd that the temperature-calibrated spectra 
don't fit 100%? They should, and the actual sample seems like a better 
temperature indicator to me than a somewhat artificial MeOH sample.

Currently I'm measuring a whole set of &quot;TROSY-calibrated&quot; spectra, I'll see 
if they give me different results in the consistency tests.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

For permanent reference I have attached the two PDF files you have
uploaded to dropbox into a special 'patch' tracker entry at
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://gna.org/patch/?3587">https://gna.org/patch/?3587</a>.  The new file links are:

</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">From your spectra (the above file links), it looks suspiciously as
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">though you have an exchange process occurring (though it may not be
the case).  Have you measured relaxation dispersion data for the
system?


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">* select the temperature where the NH spectra are nearly 100% identical
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

If temperature calibration is important, then you should run the
experiment on methanol or ethylene glycol to calibrate.  Otherwise if
the spectra are the same but just shifted because of temperature, then
it's not so important.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

I never saw any differences in MeOH proton peak distance when running the 
different T1/T2/HetNOE experiments against a standard methanol sample, 
regardless if it was HSQC-based or TROSY-based.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Maybe MeOH was not suitable for the temperature used?


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">If you take your NH spectra from different, MeOH-calibrated 
magnets/temperature units and superimpose them â€“ are they completely 
identical? Don't you see any differences? I always have to re-adjust my 
reference peak lists to find the peaks in the spectra of the different 
spectrometers.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

For me, the spectra are perfectly identical.  The only differences are
due to spectral noise shifting the peak randomly in height and
chemical shift in all directions equally.


</pre><blockquote class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre style="margin: 0em;">run a quick 1D after running a short version of the experiment.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

That's what I did. I pulsed for 15-20 minutes for the system to equilibrate 
and immediatley took a proton 1D to determine the peak distance.

Maybe I should consider using ethylen glycol since the methanol calibration 
method seems to be less suited for temperatures around 300-310 K where 
we're working with? Are you determining the distance &quot;by hand&quot; or via a 
peak-picking mechanism inside topspin? Do you use deuterated methanol or 
standard protonated one?
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

I would recommend ethylene glycol.  Have a look at the published
literature on NMR temperature calibration and see what is best.  Maybe
you need to modify the phases on your pulses to preserve the ethylene
glycol magnetisation but destroying the water and protein signals, and
then use the data from the recorded 2D for your calibrations.  This
would avoid quick cooling between the experiments.

Regards,

Edward

    <h3>relax 1.3.14</h3>

    <p>The following are screenshots of <a href="download.html#All_releases">relax 1.3.14</a> in <a href="features.html#UI">GUI mode</a> , showing the different GUI elements and features.  These have been taken on GNU/Linux, specifically <a href="http://www.mageia.org">Mageia 1</a>.  The relax GUI will adapt to the native look and feel of the host operating system, so will have a slightly different appearance on MS Windows and Mac OS X.</p>
